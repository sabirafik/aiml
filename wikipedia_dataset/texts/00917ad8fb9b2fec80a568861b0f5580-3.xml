Particularly striking in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to musical form.Walker, ''Weimar'', 308. As purely musical structures, the symphonic poems do not follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifs&mdash;recurring melodies associated with a subject&mdash;are thematically transformed in a manner similar to that later made famous by Richard Wagner.MacDonald, ''New Grove'' (1980), 18:429. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are foreshortened, while codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes.Walker, ''Weimar'', 309. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.Walker, ''Weimar'', 304.

 

Part of this creative experimentation was a trial-and-error approach. Liszt constructed compositions with varying sections of music not necessarily having distinct beginnings and ends.Mueller, 329, 331f. He sketched sections, sometimes without fully completing them, on a small number of staves with some indication of the orchestration.Walker, ''Weimar'', 199.Searle, ''Music'', 68. After an assistant&mdash;August Conradi from 1848 to 1849, Joachim Raff from 1850 to 1853&mdash;had realized Liszt's ideas and provided a score of an acceptable standard,,Searle, ''Music'', 68&ndash;9. Liszt would then make further revisions;Walker, ''Weimar'', 199, 203.Searle, ''Music'', 69. he moved sections to form different structural relationships, and modified connective materials or composed them anew, completing the piece of music. The score was copied, then tried out in rehearsals with the Weimarian Court orchestra and further changes made in the light of practical experience.Searle, ''New Grove'' (1980), 11:41.Walker, ''New Grove'' (2001), 14:772. Many years later, Liszt reminisced how his compositional development hinged on hearing an orchestra perform his works: "I needed to hear them in order to get an idea of them." He added that it was much more for this reason, and not simply for securing a public for his own works, that he promoted them in Weimar and elsewhere. After many such stages of composition, rehearsal and revision, Liszt might reach a version where the musical form seemed balanced and he was satisfied. However, it was his habit to write modifications to already printed scores. From his perspective, his compositions remained "works in progress" as he continued to reshape, rework, or add and subtract material. In some instances, a composition could exist in four or five versions simultaneously.Mueller, 329.Walker, ''Virtuoso'', 306. 

''Tasso'', based on the life of sixteenth-century Italian poet, Torquato Tasso, is a perfect example of both Liszt's working method and his achievements based on restless experimentation. The 1849 version following a conventional overture layout, divided into a slow section ("Lament") and a fast one ("Triumph"). Even with this division, the entire work was actually a set of variations on a single melodyâ€”a folk hymn sung to Liszt by a gondolier in Venice in the late 1830s.Searle, "Orchestral Works", 287. Among the most significant revisions Liszt made was the addition of a middle section in the vein of a minuet. The theme of the minuet was, again, a variant of the gondolier's folk hymn, thus becoming another example of thematic transformation. Calmer than either of the outer sections, it was intended to depict Tasso's more stable years in the employment of the Este family in Ferrara.Searle, "Orchestral Works", 288.  In a margin note, Liszt informs the conductor that the orchestra "assumes a dual role" in this section; strings play a self-contained piece based on the original version of the gondolier's hymn while woodwinds play another based on the variation used in the minuet. This was very much in the manner of Italian composer Pietro Raimondi, whose contrapuntal mastery was such that he had written three oratorios&mdash;''Joseph'', ''Potiphar'' and ''Jacob''&mdash;which could be performed either individually or together. Liszt made a study of Raimondi's work but the Italian composer died before Liszt could meet him personally.Walker, ''Weimar'', 317, 319. While the minuet section was probably added to act as a musical bridge between the opening lament and final triumphal sections,Searle, ''New Grove'' (1980), 11:42. it along with other modifications "rendered the 'Tasso Overture' an overture no longer&mdash;far too long and developed; thus its designation as a symphonic poem."
