During the 1928&ndash;29 season, a strong England team captained by Percy Chapman toured Australia for a five-Test Ashes series.Frith, p. 34. Seeking selection in the Australian Test side, Jackson failed twice in a match designated as a Test trial in Melbourne.Frith, p. 35. In the next match, against the English for New South Wales, he scored 4 and 40 while his team-mates Bradman and Kippax both made centuries. Both Bradman and Kippax were selected for the First Test at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, Jackson missed out.Frith, pp. 36&ndash;37.  Keeping his name in front of the selectors, he scored 162 and 90 against South Australia.Frith, p. 37. After Australia lost the first three Tests and the Ashes, the selectors gave Jackson his opportunity, selecting him for his Test début in the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval.Frith, pp. 38&ndash;39.  Arthur Mailey, his club captain and the only other Test player from Balmain CC to that time, ran from his office at the ''Sydney Sun'' to Kippax's sports store in Martin Place to tell Jackson the good news.Harte, pp. 314&ndash;315. The distance between the ''Sun'' building on Elizabeth St and Kippax's store was around 880 yards (800 m) or less. 


England batted first and made 334.  In reply, Jackson opened the batting with Bill Woodfull.Frith, pp. 39&ndash;41.  Before the Test, the Australian skipper, Jack Ryder, approached Kippax for his opinion about such a young player as Jackson being given the responsibility of opening the batting.  Kippax replied, "I am sure he expects to open." After Australia lost three wickets for 19 runs, Ryder joined Jackson at the wicket.  Playing in an unhurried manner, Jackson looked confident against the pace of Harold Larwood and punished Maurice Tate when his bowling strayed down the leg side. In 105 minutes, Jackson and Ryder added 100 runs.  Jackson reached his half century, followed by Ryder and at stumps on the second day, Australia's total was 3/131. 

The exertion had left Jackson exhausted.  His team-mate "Stork" Hendry said that Jackson was limp when he returned to the dressing room. "We had to mop him with cold towels", he said.Roebuck, pp. 40&ndash;41.  Early the next day, Ryder was dismissed and Jackson was joined by Bradman. The two young batsmen shared a long partnership, with Jackson on 97 at the end of the session.Frith, pp. 42&ndash;43. As they returned to the wicket after the interval, Bradman advised his younger colleague to play carefully to secure his century. Jackson made no reply, but responded by hitting the first ball from Larwood to the point boundary for four runs, the ball rebounding back on to the field in front of a cheering crowd in the Members' Stand.Bradman, p. 23.  After this, he cut loose, with deft glances from the faster balls and cut shots reminiscent of Charlie Macartney.Frith, pp. 39&ndash;44. Jackson was eventually dismissed for 164, making him the youngest Australian batsman to score a Test century, a record beaten by Neil Harvey in 1948. It is still the second highest score on Test début by an Australian, only one run fewer than Charles Bannerman's 165 not out in the first-ever Test in 1877. This innings saw Jackson hailed as a national hero and he was showered with tributes including a public meeting called in his honour by the Mayor of Balmain.Frith, p. 45.

In 1929&ndash;30, ill-health restricted Jackson to just five first-class matches and five innings for Balmain. Despite his health, Jackson had a successful season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly ''en route'' to New Zealand. He was seen as an automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England.Frith, pp. 53&ndash;57. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches.Frith, p. 58. His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.
