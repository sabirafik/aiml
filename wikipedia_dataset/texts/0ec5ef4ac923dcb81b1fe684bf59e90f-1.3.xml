By September Scott had completed his first novel, ''This Side of Paradise'', and the manuscript was quickly accepted for publication. When he heard the novel had been accepted, Scott wrote to publisher Maxwell Perkins, urging an accelerated release: "I have so many things dependent on its success—including of course a girl". In November he returned to Montgomery, triumphant with the news of his novel. Zelda agreed to marry him once the book was published; he, in turn, promised to bring her to New York with "all the iridescence of the beginning of the world". ''This Side of Paradise'' was published on March 26, Zelda arrived in New York on March 30, and on April 3, 1920, before a small wedding party in St. Patrick's Cathedral, they married.; ; 

Scott and Zelda became celebrities of New York, as much for their wild behavior as for the success of ''This Side of Paradise''. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness; Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square; when Dorothy Parker first met them, Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, "They did both look as though they had just stepped out of the sun; their youth was striking. ''Everyone'' wanted to meet him". Their social life was fueled with alcohol; publicly this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, in the pages of the New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—''enfants terribles'' of the Jazz Age.; ; ; Bryer, Jackson R. "A Brief Biography". In .

On Valentine's Day 1921, while Scott was working to finish his second novel, ''The Beautiful and Damned'', Zelda discovered she was pregnant. They decided to go to Scott's home in St. Paul, Minnesota to have the baby.; Bryer in . On October 26, 1921 she gave birth to Frances "Scottie" Fitzgerald. As she emerged from the anesthesia, Scott recorded Zelda saying, "Oh, God, goofo I'm drunk. Mark Twain. Isn't she smart—she has the hiccups. I hope its beautiful and a fool—a beautiful little fool". Many of her words found their way into Scott's novels; in ''The Great Gatsby'', the character Daisy Buchanan expresses the same hope for her daughter.; 


As a mother, Fitzgerald never became particularly domestic or showed any interest in housekeeping. By 1922 the Fitzgeralds employed a nurse for their daughter, a couple to clean house, and a laundress for cleaning. When Harper & Brothers asked her to contribute to ''Favorite Recipes of Famous Women'' she wrote: "See if there is any bacon, and if there is ask the cook which pan to fry it in. Then ask if there are any eggs, and if so try and persuade the cook to poach two of them. It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns very easily. Also, in the case of bacon do not turn the fire too high, or you will have to get out of the house for a week. Serve preferably on china plates, though gold or wood will do if handy".Lanahan, Dorothy. "Introduction". In 

In early 1922, Fitzgerald again became pregnant. It is presumed she had an abortion,Bryer in  in March Scott recorded in his ledger, "Zelda & her abortionist". Zelda's thoughts on the second pregnancy are unknown, but in the first draft of ''The Beautiful and Damned'', the novel Scott was completing, he wrote a scene in which the main female character Gloria believes she is pregnant and Anthony suggests she "talk to some woman and find out what's best to be done. Most of them fix it some way". Anthony's suggestion was removed from the final version, a change which shifted focus from the abortion choice to Gloria's concern that a baby would ruin her figure.; 


As ''The Beautiful and Damned'' neared publication, Burton Rascoe, the freshly appointed literary editor of the ''New York Tribune'', approached Zelda for an opportunity to entice readers with a cheeky review of Scott's latest work. In her review, she made joking reference to the use of her diaries in Scott's work, but the lifted material became a genuine source of resentment:


To begin with, every one must buy this book for the following aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and also if enough people buy it where there is a platinum ring with a complete circlet, and also if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has has done well enough for the last three years ... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and also scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.Lanahan. In 

The piece led to Zelda receiving offers from other magazines. In June, a piece by Zelda Fitzgerald, "Eulogy on the Flapper", was published in ''Metropolitan Magazine''. Though ostensibly a piece about the decline of the Flapper lifestyle, Zelda's biographer Nancy Milford wrote that the essay was "a defense of her own code of existence". Zelda described the Flapper:


The Flapper awoke from her lethargy of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, put on her choicest pair of earrings and a great deal of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure ... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.

Zelda continued writing, selling several short stories and articles. She helped Scott write the play ''The Vegetable'', but when it flopped the Fitzgeralds found themselves in debt. Scott wrote short stories furiously to pay the bills, but became burned out and depressed. In April 1924, they left for Paris.
