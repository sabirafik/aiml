The mainstream literary style was to lose popularity during the mid-12th century Kalachuri rule, due to the rise of revolutionary notions about the social and cultural order. The Veerashaivas, acting in protest, used the pure form of Kannada language in their poems; moreover, they encouraged writers from lower castes to participate and completely eliminated themes that had been considered formal by the king and the monastery.Nagaraj (2003), pp. 346&ndash;348; 353&ndash;354 Thus, written in native metres, in a language close to the spoken form of Kannada, the ''Vachana'' poems gained mass appeal.Nagaraj (2003), pp. 353&ndash;354 A new religious faith was thereby propagated by the Veerashaivas whose ascendancy is called the "Veerashaiva movement" and their communicative genre, the ''Vachana''.Nagaraj (2003), pp. 346&ndash;347 While the ''Vachana'' poetry is generally categorised as a part of the pan-Indian ''Bhakti'' (devotional) literature, such generalisations tend to disguise the very esoteric and anti-''bhakti'' positions taken by many ''Vachanakaras''.Nagaraj (2003), pp. 347&ndash;348 The origin of the Veerashaiva ideology and the beginnings of their poetry is unclear. According to D.R. Nagaraj, a scholar on literary cultures in history, modern scholars tend to favour two broad views: integrationist and indigenist. The integrationists, such as L. Basavaraju, trace the source of ''Vachana'' poetic tradition to the Sanskrit Upanishad scriptures and the Agama doctrine, though this does not explain why the movement did not blossom earlier or in the neighbouring Telugu-speaking region where radical Shaiva sects were known to be active. The indigenists, such as Chidananda Murthy, M.M. Kalaburgi and G.S. Shivarudrappa, propose a native Karnataka origin of the poetry, though they are yet to fully explain its unique nature.
