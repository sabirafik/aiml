Like with most exotic pets, owning a raccoon often takes a significant amount of time and patience.http://www.filthylucre.com/raccoon-as-a-pet Raccoons may act unpredictably and aggressively and it can be quite difficult to teach them to obey and understand commands.Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 173–174 In places where keeping raccoons as pets is not forbidden, such as in Wisconsin and other U.S. states, an exotic pet permit may be required.MacClintock, p. 129

Sexually mature raccoons often show aggressive natural behaviors such as biting during the mating season.Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 185–186 Neutering them at around five or six months of age decreases the chances of aggressive behavior developing.Hohmann, p. 186 Raccoons can become obese and suffer from other disorders due to poor diet and lack of exercise.Hohmann, p. 185 When fed with cat food over a long time period, raccoons can develop gout.Hohmann, p. 180 With respect to the research results regarding their social behavior, it is now required by law in Austria and Germany to keep at least two individuals to prevent loneliness. Raccoons are usually kept in a pen (indoor or outdoor), also a legal requirement in Austria and Germany, rather than in the apartment where their natural curiosity may result in damage to property.Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 184, 187; MacClintock, p. 130–131

When orphaned, it is possible for kits to be rehabilitated and reintroduced to the wild. However, it is uncertain whether they re-adapt well to life in the wild.MacClintock, p. 130 Feeding unweaned kits with cow milk rather than a kitten replacement milk or a similar product can be dangerous to their health.Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 175–176
