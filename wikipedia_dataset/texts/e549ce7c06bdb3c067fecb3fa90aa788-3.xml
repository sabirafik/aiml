''Herrerasaurus'' was named by paleontologist Osvaldo Reig after Victorino Herrera, an Andean goatherd who first noticed its fossils in outcrops near the city of San Juan in 1959. These rocks, which later yielded ''Eoraptor'', are part of the Ischigualasto Formation and date from the late Ladinian to early Carnian stages of the Late Triassic period. Reig named a second dinosaur from these rocks in the same publication as ''Herrerasaurus''; this dinosaur, ''Ischisaurus cattoi'', is now considered a junior synonym and a juvenile of ''Herrerasaurus''.  Two other partial skeletons, with skull material, were named ''Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis'' by Fernando Novas in 1986, but this species too is now thought to be a synonym.

Reig believed ''Herrerasaurus'' was an early example of a carnosaur, but this was the subject of much debate over the next 30 years, and the genus was variously classified during that time. In 1970, Steel classified ''Herrerasaurus'' as a prosauropod. In 1972, Peter Galton classified the genus as not diagnosable beyond Saurischia. Later, using cladistic analysis, some researchers put ''Herrerasaurus'' and ''Staurikosaurus'' at the base of the dinosaur tree before the separation between ornithischians and saurischians. Several researchers classified the remains as non-dinosaurian.
 
A complete ''Herrerasaurus'' skull was not found until 1988, by a team of paleontologists led by Paul Sereno. Based on the new fossils, authors such as Thomas Holtz and Jose Bonaparte classified ''Herrerasaurus'' at the base of the saurischian tree before the divergence between prosauropods and theropods. However, Sereno favored classifying ''Herrerasaurus'' (and the Herrerasauridae) as primitive theropods. These two classifications have become the most persistent, with Rauhut (2003) and Bittencourt and Kellner (2004) favoring the early theropod hypothesis, and Max Langer (2004), Langer and Benton (2006), and Randall Irmis and his coauthors (2007) favoring the basal saurischian hypothesis. If ''Herrerasaurus'' were indeed a theropod, it would indicate that theropods, sauropodomorphs, and ornithischians diverged even earlier than herrerasaurids, before the middle Carnian, and that "all three lineages independently evolved several dinosaurian features, such as a more advanced ankle joint or an open acetabulum". This view is further supported by ichnological records showing large tridactyl (three-toed) footprints that can be attributed only to a theropod dinosaur. These footprints date from the Ladinian (Middle Triassic) of the Los Rastros Formation in Argentina and predate ''Herrerasaurus'' by 3 to 5 million years.

The study of early dinosaurs such as ''Herrerasaurus'' and ''Eoraptor'' therefore has important implications for the concept of dinosaurs as a monophyletic group (a group descended from a common ancestor). The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who compiled a list of cranial and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the common ancestor). Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of ''Herrerasaurus'' by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a common ancestor, and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of ''Herrerasaurus'' also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.
