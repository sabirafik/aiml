The King Vulture was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his ''Systema Naturae'' as ''Vultur papa''.  It was reassigned to the genus ''Sarcoramphus'' in 1805 by André Marie Constant Duméril. The generic name is a New Latin compound formed from the Greek words σάρξ (''sarx'', "flesh", the combining form of which is σαρκο-) and ῥάμφος (''rhamphos'', "crooked beak of bird of prey"). The genus name is often misspelled as ''Sarcor'''h'''amphus'', improperly retaining the Greek rough breathing despite agglutination with the previous word-element. The bird was also assigned to the genus ''Gyparchus'' by Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger in 1841, but this classification is not used in modern literature since ''Sarcoramphus'' has priority as the earlier name. The King Vulture's closest living relative is the Andean Condor, ''Vultur gryphus''. Some authors have even put these species in a separate subfamily from the other New World vultures, though most authors consider this subdivision unnecessary.


There are two theories on how the King Vulture earned the "King" part of its common name. The first is that the name is a reference to its habit of displacing smaller vultures from a carcass and eating its fill while they wait. An alternative theory reports that the name is derived from Mayan legends, in which the bird was a king who served as a messenger between humans and the gods. This bird was also known as the "White Crow" by the Spanish in Paraguay.

The exact systematic placement of the King Vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks.Sibley, Charles G. and Burt L.

More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vulturesSibley, Charles G., and Jon E. Ahlquist. 1991. ''''. Yale University Press.
