"No Such Thing as Vampires" finished first among total viewers and adults 18–49 for its night. It was seen by 8.54 million American viewers, and received a 5.7 household rating and a 10% share of all televisions in use. The critical responses to the pilot were overall unfavorable. Several critics compared it detrimentally with the television series ''Angel'', as well as other vampire related media, including ''Forever Knight'', ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ''Blood Ties'', ''The Night Stalker'', ''Dark Shadows'' and the works of Anne Rice. Tim Goodman of ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' considered it as a "flat-out awful" pilot of what "may well be the worst new fall show". Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described the pilot as "a weak, generic private-eye drama with a vampire story overlay", and Matthew Gilbert of the ''Boston Globe'' felt that it came close to a "full-on nightmare".

The writing of the pilot was critizised as "ponderous", and having "familiar, conventional plots". One critic claimed it did not offer much "to inspire an actor", while another thought it had the "worst writing of the new season". The dialogue was described as "groan-inducing". Tom Shales of ''The Washington Post'' criticized the series creators' decision to make St. John a private investigator, and felt that they "appear eager to avoid what makes their show unique". Mary McNamara of the ''Los Angeles Times'' saw promise in the series, but remarked it got "lost between concept and execution, and instead of suspense we get silliness, as if the creators were determined to use only the clichés of both genres". The acting of the pilot was criticized as "sub-par" and "woeful". Robert Bianco of ''USA Today'' felt that ''Moonlight'' had a "less adept cast" than ''Angel''. Matthew Gilbert of the ''Boston Globe'' depreciated the chemistry between O'Loughlin and Myles as "artificial", and said that they "exchange lines of dialogue with a stilted rhythm and no natural flow". O'Loughlin was described as a "flatliner", and "passable in the lead role", while Sossamon's appearance was said to be "preposterously not-scary". Travis Fickett of IGN praised the actors, however, and felt that O'Loughlin did "a decent job", and that Myles was "perhaps the most promising aspect of the show". Maureen Ryan of the ''Chicago Tribune'' commended Myles as "reasonably good".

Not all reviews, however, were negative. Sarah Stegall of SF Scope gave the pilot a decent review, and said that if ''Moonlight'' could survive "the Friday night time slot" and the "thwarted expectations of  fans who were expecting ''Blade''", she thought it would "rock". Kara Howland of ''TV Guide'' gave the pilot a positive review, and thought it was a "solid start". Several critics praised Jason Dohring's portrayal of Josef. One said that he gave the pilot "a small burst of energy", while another said that he made it "crackle with a bit of wit". Dohring was described as "a welcome presence", and one critic wished for "a bit more screen time". Travis Fickett of IGN praised the action scenes, and noted that "once the action gets started, it plays well".
