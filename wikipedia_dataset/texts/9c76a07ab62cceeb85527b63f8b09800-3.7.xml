Although most prisoners quietly accepted their fate during World War II, there was some resistance in the camps.  Poston, Heart Mountain, Topaz, and Tule Lake each had civil disturbances about wage differences, black marketing of sugar, intergenerational friction, rumors of “informers” reporting to the camp administration or the FBI, and other issues. However, the most serious incident occurred at Manzanar on December 5&ndash;6, 1942, and became known as the Manzanar Riot.

After several months of tension between prisoners who supported the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) and a group of ''Kibei'' (Japanese Americans educated in Japan), rumors spread that sugar and meat shortages were the result of black marketing by camp administrators.  To make matters worse, prisoner and JACL leader Fred Tayama was beaten by six masked men.  Harry Ueno, the leader of the Kitchen Workers Union, was suspected of involvement and was arrested and removed from Manzanar.  Soon after, 3,000 to 4,000 prisoners gathered and marched to the administration area, protesting Ueno's arrest.  After Ueno's supporters negotiated with the camp administration, he was returned to the Manzanar jail.  A crowd of several hundred returned to protest, and when the people surged forward, military police threw tear gas to disperse them.  As people ran to avoid the tear gas, some in the crowd pushed a driverless truck toward the jail.  At that moment, the military police fired into the crowd, killing a 17&ndash;year&ndash;old boy instantly.  A 21&ndash;year&ndash;old man who was shot in the abdomen died days later.  Nine other prisoners were wounded, and a military police corporal was wounded by a ricocheting bullet.
