Seth Warner sailed a detachment up the lake and captured nearby Fort Crown Point, garrisoned by only nine men.  It is widely recorded that this capture occurred on May 10; this is attributed to a letter Arnold wrote to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety on May 11, claiming that an attempt to sail up to Crown Point was frustrated by headwinds.  However Warner claimed, in a letter dated May 12 from "Head Quarters, Crown Point", that he "took possession of this garrison" the day before.  It appears likely that, having failed on May 10, the attempt was repeated the next day with success, as reported in Warner's memoir.Chipman (1848), p. 141  A small force was also sent to capture Fort George on Lake George, which was held by only two soldiers.Randall (1990), p. 98

Troops recruited by Arnold's captains began to arrive, some after seizing Philip Skene's schooner ''Katherine'' and several bateaux at Skenesboro.Smith (1907), p. 155Morrissey (2000), p. 10  Arnold rechristened the schooner .  The prisoners had reported that the lone British warship on Lake Champlain was at Fort Saint-Jean, on the Richelieu River north of the lake.  Arnold, uncertain whether word of Ticonderoga's capture had reached Saint-Jean, decided to attempt a raid to capture the ship.  He had ''Liberty'' outfitted with guns, and sailed north with 50 of his men on May 14.Randall (1990), p. 101  Allen, not wanting Arnold to get the full glory for that capture, followed with some of his men in bateaux, but Arnold's small fleet had the advantage of sail, and pulled away from Allen's boats.  By May 17, Arnold's small fleet was at the northern end of the lake.  Seeking intelligence, Arnold sent a man to reconnoiter the situation at Fort Saint-Jean.  The scout returned later that day, reporting that the British were aware of the fall of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and that troops were apparently on the move toward Saint-Jean.  Arnold decided to act immediately.Randall (1990), p. 103

Rowing all night, Arnold and 35 of his men brought their bateaux near the fort.  After a brief scouting excursion, they surprised the small garrison at the fort, and seized supplies there, along with the , a seventy-ton sloop.Smith (1907), p. 157  Warned by their captives that several companies were on their way from Chambly, they loaded the more valuable supplies and cannons on the ''George'', which Arnold renamed the .  Boats that they could not take were sunk, and the enlarged fleet returned to Lake Champlain.  This activity was observed by Moses Hazen, a retired British officer who lived near the fort.  Hazen rode to Montreal to report the action to the local military commander, and then continued on to Quebec City, where he reported the news to General Carleton on May 20.  Major Charles Preston and 140Â men were immediately dispatched from Montreal to Saint-Jean in response to Hazen's warning.Lanctot (1967), pp. 44,50

Fifteen miles out on the lake, Arnold's fleet met Allen's, which was still heading north.  After an exchange of celebratory gunfire, Arnold opened his stores to feed Allen's men, who had rowed  in open boats without provisions.  Allen, believing he could seize and hold Fort Saint-Jean, continued north, while Arnold sailed south.Randall (1990), p. 105  Allen arrived at Saint-Jean on May 19,  where he was warned that British troops were approaching by a sympathetic Montreal merchant, who had raced ahead of those troops on horseback.Lanctot (1967), p. 44  Allen, after penning a message for the merchant to deliver to the citizens of Montreal, returned to Ticonderoga on May 21, leaving Saint-Jean just as the British forces arrived.Randall (1990), p. 106  In their haste to escape the British, three men were left behind; one was captured, but the other two eventually returned south by land.Jellison (1969), p. 131
