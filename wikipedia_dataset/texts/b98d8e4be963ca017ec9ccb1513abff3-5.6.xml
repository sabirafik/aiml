There are over  of hiking trails at Worlds End State Park. Most of the trails are rocky and steep, so hikers are encouraged to wear proper footgear and to be prepared for icy conditions during the cold winter months.   As John Young writes in ''Hike Pennsylvania'' "If you want to do some hiking in the Worlds End region, you should know that hiking here means climbing". Worlds End State Park is open during the winter months for snow mobiling and cross-country skiing. Most of the trails are too steep or rugged for either activity, but the park roads are open, as are trails on surrounding state forest lands.
* '''Loyalsock Trail''', often abbreviated LT, is a rugged  hiking trail that stretches from near Loyalsockville, in Lycoming County on Pennsylvania Route 87 to north of Laporte in Sullivan County, just off U.S. Route 220. This trail follows the ridges and streams of the Loyalsock Creek watershed. The trail is primarily within the boundaries of Loyalsock State Forest and uses some old logging roads and abandoned railroad grades. The Loyalsock Trail is blazed in a yellow rectangle with a red stripe, and red can lids with a yellow "LT".      
* '''Link Trail''' is a moderate  trail marked with a red X on a yellow circle blaze. The trail starts at the Cabin Bridge in the park and follows Loyalsock Creek before it branches off and follows Double Run. The trail then ascends to Canyon Vista and heads out into Loyalsock State Forest where it links up with the Loyalsock Trail at the  post. The Loyalsock Trail can be followed back for a  long loop.
* '''Canyon Vista Trail''' is a  loop trail with blue blazes that passes through the eastern portion of the park and a stand of ash, Sugar Maple, and Black Cherry trees. This trail passes a maze-like jumble of blocky Pottsville Formation rocks known as the Rock Garden, adjacent to Canyon Vista. The vista is at an elevation of  and "rewards the hiker with a spectacular view of the Loyalsock Creek gorge".
* '''Worlds End Trail''' is a  trail with yellow blazes that begins at the park office and ascends to an overlook of the swimming area. It then crosses the old Pioneer Road, which was used by some of the first settlers to the area, and enters the Loyalsock State Forest, ending at the  post of the Loyalsock Trail, which can be followed back to the park office to make a loop  long. 
* '''Butternut Trail''' is a  trail marked with orange blazes that loops through a hardwood forest and crosses over Butternut Run. Two side trails connect Butternut Trail with the Loyalsock Trail.
* '''Double Run Nature Trail''' is an easy  trail, marked with a green stripe on a white rectangle blaze, that loops through woodlands along the west branch of Double Run. Wildflowers like Jack-in-the-Pulpit, Solomon's Seal and wild ginger can be seen on this trail, which passes by an intermittent waterfall.
* '''High Rock Trail''' is  and passes a waterfall on High Rock Run. This steep trail is marked with red blazes and climbs a hollow filled with lichen-covered rocks to a vista. A part of this trail used to pass so close to cliffs that two hikers fell to their deaths; this part of the trail has been relocated for safety.
