In an interview with Pitchfork Media in October 2007, Taylor said there would be an equal proportion of electronic elements to live material, as the band doesn't "do things by adding one thing and taking something else away". The album contained maximalist and minimalist songs; several tracks on the album were influenced by rock and heavy metal music, and the track "Wrestlers" started taking a new direction because the band was "wrestling with the idea of making an R. Kelly kind of slick R and B number" and ultimately " more like Randy Newman's "Short People".  He said, "if the press release says it's faster and rockier it doesn't account for that fact that there are more ballads on this record than any other record." Taylor said that feelings of happiness and love influenced the album's romantic feel.

Goddard considered varying styles and influences a key factor in the band's music. He explained to ''The Sun'' that creating music could be difficult because a member could introduce a different influence. Goddard and Doyle said that clashes and restlessness during recording led to "unpleasant" periods of silence, but ultimately thought the clashes created "something more interesting because you have these different voices and not one person dictating".

Martin told ''The Georgia Straight'' that the group are "afflicted with something akin to musical attention-deficit disorder" and said that the group "get bored quite easily  with  own records at times". He elaborated by saying that the group aren't "really interested in reproducing the same sound" because they don't find it exciting.

Taylor stated Hot Chip "didn't set out to make something with one mood" and that he thought the band's style of "jump all over the place stylistically" made sense as a record. In an interview with ''The Georgia Straight'', Martin expressed that Hot Chip didn't want to create a "'classic' record that would have a particular sound" as they wanted to make music that was "quite experimental and out-there". ''Made in the Dark'' was intended to represent the "whole live sound of the band" and they are "a band as much as originally having been a duo".
