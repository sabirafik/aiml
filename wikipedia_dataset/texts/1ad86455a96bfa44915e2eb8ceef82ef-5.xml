Although ''Triceratops'' are commonly portrayed as herding animals, there is currently little evidence that they lived in herds. While several other genera of horned dinosaurs are known from bonebeds preserving bones from two to hundreds or thousands of individuals, to date there is only one documented bonebed dominated by ''Triceratops'' bones: a site in southeastern Montana with the remains of three juveniles. It may be significant that only juveniles were present. 

For many years, ''Triceratops'' finds were known only from solitary individuals. However, these remains are very common; for example, Bruce Erickson, a paleontologist of the Science Museum of Minnesota, has reported having seen 200 specimens of ''T. prorsus'' in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana.Erickson, B.R. (1966). Mounted skeleton of ''Triceratops prorsus'' in the Science Museum. ''Scientific Publications of the Science Museum'' '''1''':1â€“16. Similarly, Barnum Brown claimed to have seen over 500 skulls in the field.Dodson, P. (1996). ''The Horned Dinosaurs''. Princeton University Press:Princeton, New Jersey, p. 79. ISBN 0-691-02882-6. Because ''Triceratops'' teeth, horn fragments, frill fragments, and other skull fragments are such abundant fossils in the Lancian faunal stage of the late Maastrichtian (late Cretaceous, 68 to 65 mya) Period of western North America, it is regarded as among the dominant herbivores of the time, if not the most dominant herbivore. In 1986, Robert Bakker estimated it as making up 5/6ths of the large dinosaur fauna at the end of the Cretaceous.Bakker, R.T. (1986). ''The Dinosaur Heresies: New Theories Unlocking The Mystery of the Dinosaurs and Their Extinction'' William Morrow:New York, p. 438. ISBN 0140100555. Unlike most animals, skull fossils are far more common than postcranial bones for ''Triceratops'', suggesting that the skull had an unusually high preservation potential.

''Triceratops'' was one of the last ceratopsian genera to appear before the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event. The related ''Nedoceratops'' and ''Torosaurus'', and the more distantly related diminutive ''Leptoceratops'', were also present, though their remains have been rarely encountered.
