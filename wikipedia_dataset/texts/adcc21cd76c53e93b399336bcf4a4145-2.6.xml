Several fictional works have been published that are based in part on the career of the group. The 1976 film ''Sparkle'' features the story of a Supremes-like singing trio called "Sister & the Sisters" from Harlem, New York. The film's score was composed by Curtis Mayfield, and the soundtrack album by Aretha Franklin was a commercial success. A remake of ''Sparkle'' was in development in the early 2000s with R&B singer Aaliyah as the lead, but the project was shelved when Aaliyah died in 2001."". ''Entertainment Weekly'', June 21, 2001.

On December 21, 1981, the Tony Award-winning musical ''Dreamgirls'' opened at the Imperial Theatre on Broadway and ran for 1,522 performances. The musical, loosely based on the history of The Supremes, follows the story of The Dreams, an all-female singing trio from Chicago who become music superstars. Several of the characters in the play are analogues of real-life Supremes/Motown counterparts, with the story focusing upon the Florence Ballard doppelg√§nger Effie White. While influenced by the Supremes' and Motown's music, the songs in the play are a broader mix of R&B/soul and Broadway music. Mary Wilson loved the musical, but Diana Ross was reportedly angered by it and refused to see it.O'Niel, Tom. "". ''TheEnvelope.com.'' Retrieved on November 11, 2006.



A film adaptation of ''Dreamgirls'' was released by DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures in December 2006. The film contains more overt references to Motown and The Supremes than does the play that inspired it: for example, in the film, many of the Dreams's album covers are identical in design to Supremes album covers, and the Dreams themselves hail from Detroit - not Chicago, as do their Broadway counterparts.
