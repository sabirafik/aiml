The Black female is assaulted in her tender years by all those common forces of nature at the same time that she is caught in the tripartite crossfire of male prejudice, white illogical hate and Black lack of power.
Maya Angelou, ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings''Angelou, p. 265

In the course of ''Caged Bird'', Maya, who has been described as "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America", goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self-aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong sense of her own identity.  Feminist scholar Maria Lauret states that the "formation of female cultural identity" is woven into the book's narrative, setting Maya up as "a role model for Black women".Lauret,   African American literature scholar Dolly McPherson states that Angelou, in her demonstration of the passage from childhood to young adulthood, creatively uses "the Christian myth" and presents the themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth.  Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou's "identity theme" and a major motif in Angelou's narrative.  Maya's unsettled life in ''Caged Bird'' suggests her sense of self "as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications".Arensberg, p. 115

As Lauret indicates, Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society.  Lauret sees a connection between  Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret calls "fictions of subjectivity" and "feminist first-person narratives", and fictional first-person narratives (such as ''The Women's Room'' by Marilyn French and ''The Golden Notebook'' by Doris Lessing) written during the same period.  Both genres employ the narrator as protagonist and "rely upon the illusion of presence in their mode of signification".Lauret,   

As a displaced girl, Maya's pain is worsened by an awareness of her displacement.  She is "the forgotten child", and must come to terms with "the unimaginable reality" of being unloved and unwanted;McPherson, p. 28 she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a black girl.  Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced â€“ her belief in her own ugliness was "absolute".McPherson, p. 25  McPherson believes that the concept of family, or what Lupton called "kinship concerns",Lupton,  in Angelou's books must be understood in the light of the children's displacement at the beginning of ''Caged Bird''.McPherson, p. 14  Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey.Smith, p. 52


Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities throughout her books to illustrate how oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in ''Caged Bird'', Angelou demonstrates the "racist habit" of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her "Mary".  Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the "hellish horror of being 'called out of  name'".Angelou, p. 91  Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image.King, p. 189  According to scholar Sidonie Ann Smith, the renaming emphasizes Maya's feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness.  Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's favorite dish.Smith, p. 53

An incident in the book that solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time.  Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally "in control of her fate".Smith, p. 54  This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend.  These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth.  

Beginning in ''Caged Bird'', motherhood is a "prevailing theme" in Angelou's autobiographies.  Scholar Mary Burgher believes that female black autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African American mothers as "breeder and matriarch", and have presented them as having "a creative and personally fulfilling role".Burgher, p. 115  Lupton believes that Angelou's plot construction and character development were influenced by the same mother/child motif found in the work of Harlem Renaissance poet Jessie Fauset.Lupton,   For the first five years of her life, Maya thinks of herself as an orphan and finds comfort in the thought that her mother was dead.  Maya's feelings for and relationship with her own mother, whom she blames for her abandonment, express themselves in ambivalence and "repressed violent aggression".Arensberg, p. 118  For example, Maya and her brother destroy the first Christmas gifts sent by their mother.  These strong feelings are not resolved until the end of the book, when Maya becomes a mother herself, and her mother finally becomes the nurturing presence for which Maya has longed.Arensberg, p. 126
