During this period, Ray composed films on the British Raj period (such as ''Devi''), a documentary on Tagore, a comic film (''Mahapurush'') and his first film from an original screenplay (''Kanchenjungha''). He also made a series of films that, taken together, are considered by critics among the most deeply felt portrayal of Indian women on screen.

Ray followed ''Apur Sansar'' with ''Devi'' (''The Goddess''), a film in which are studied the superstitions in the Hindu society. Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee, a young wife who is deified by her father-in-law. Ray was worried that the censor board might block his film, or at least make him re-cut it, but Devi was spared. In 1961, on the insistence of Prime-minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ray was commissioned to make a documentary on Rabindranath Tagore, on the occasion of the poet's birth centennial, a tribute to the person who probably influenced Ray most. Due to limited real footage of Tagore available, Ray faced the challenge of making a film out of mainly static material, and he remarked that it took as much work as three feature films. In the same year, together with Subhas Mukhopadhyay and others, Ray was able to revive ''Sandesh'', the children's magazine his grandfather once published. Ray had been saving money for some years now to make this possible. A duality in the name (''Sandesh'' means both "news" in Bengali and also a sweet desert popular in Bengal) set the tone of the magazine (both educational and entertaining), and Ray soon found himself illustrating the magazine, and writing stories and essays for children. Writing became his major source of income in the years to come.

In 1962, Ray directed ''Kanchenjungha'', which was his first original screenplay and colour film. The film tells the story of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in Darjeeling, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal, where the family tries to engage their youngest daughter to a highly-paid engineer educated in London. The film was first conceived to take place in a large mansion, but Ray later decided to film it in the famous hill town, using the many shades of light and mist to reflect the tension in the drama. An amused Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting conditions, a commercial film contingent present at the same time in Darjeeling failed to shoot a single shot as they only wanted to do so in sunshine.

In the sixties, Ray visited Japan and took particular pleasure in meeting filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, for whom he had very high regard. While at home, he would take an occasional break from the hectic city life by going to places like Darjeeling or Puri to complete a script in isolation.

In 1964 Ray made ''Charulata'' (''The Lonely Wife''), the culmination of this period of work, and regarded by many critics as his most accomplished film. Based on ''Nastanirh'', a short story of Tagore, the film tells the tale of a lonely wife, Charu, in 19th century Bengal, and her growing feelings for her brother in law, Amal. Often referred to as Ray's Mozartian masterpiece, Ray himself famously said the film contained least flaws among his work, and his only work, that given a chance, he would make exactly the same way. Madhabi Mukherjee's performance as Charu, and the work of both Subrata Mitra and Bansi Chandragupta in the film have been highly praised. Other films in this period include ''Mahanagar'' (''The Big City''), ''Teen Kanya'' (''Three Daughters''), ''Abhijan'' (''The Expedition'') and ''Kapurush o Mahapurush'' (''The Coward and the Holy Man'').
