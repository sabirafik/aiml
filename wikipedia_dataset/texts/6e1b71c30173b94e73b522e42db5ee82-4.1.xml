The defeat of the Jain Western Ganga Dynasty by the Cholas in early 11th century and the rising numbers of  followers of Vaishnava Hinduism and Virashaivism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism.Kamath (2001), p112, p132 Two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The decline of Buddhism in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of Adi Shankara's Advaita philosophy.A 16th century Buddhist work by Lama Taranatha speaks disparagingly of Shankaracharya as close parallels in some beliefs of Shankaracharya with Buddhist philosophy was not viewed favourably by Buddhist writers (Thapar 2003, pp 349–350, p397) The only places of Buddhist worship during the Hoysala time were at Dambal and Balligavi. Shantala Devi, queen of Vishnuvardhana was a Jain but nevertheless commissioned the Hindu Kappe Chennigaraya temple in Belur, evidence that the royal family was tolerant of all religions. During the rule of the Hoysalas, three important religious developments took place in present day Karnataka inspired by three philosophers, Basavanna, Madhvacharya and Ramanujacharya. 

While the origin of Virashaiva faith is debated, the movement grew through its association with Basavanna in the 12th century.It is said five earlier saints Renuka, Daruka, Ekorama, Panditharadhya and Vishwaradhya were the original founders of Virashaivism, a sect that preaches devotion to Lord Shiva (Kamath 2001, p152) Basavanna and other Virashaiva saints preached of a faith without a caste system. In his Vachanas he appealed to the masses in simple Kannada and wrote "work is worship" (''Kayakave Kailasa''). Madhvacharya was critical of the teachings of Shankaracharya and argued the world is real and not an illusion.Madvacharya upheld the virtues of Lord Vishnu and propounded the Dvaita philosophy (dualism) and condemned the "mayavada" (illusion) of Shankaracharya and maintained there was a distinction between ''Paramathma'' (supreme being) and the dependent principle of life (Kamath 2001, p155) His philosophy gained popularity enabling him to establish eight Mathas (monastery) in Udupi. Ramanujacharya, the head of the Vaishnava monastery in Srirangam, preached the way of devotion (''bhakti marga'') and wrote ''Sribhashya'', a critique on the Advaita philosophy of Adi Shankara.He criticised Adi Shankara as a "Buddhist in disguise" (Kamath 2001, p151)
 
 
The impact of these religious developments on culture, literature, poetry and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of literature and poetry based on the teachings of these  philosophers were written during the coming centuries. The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanujacharya exists in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara.Fritz and Michell (2001), pp35–36 Scholars in later Mysore Kingdom wrote  Vaishnavite works upholding the teachings of Ramanujacharya.Kamath (2001), p152  King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism.  The later saints of Madhvacharya's order, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha and devotees (''dasa'') such as Vijaya Dasa, Gopaladasa and others from the Karnataka region spread his teachings far and wide.Shiva Prakash (1997), pp192&ndash;200 His teachings inspired later day philosophers like Vallabhacharya in Gujarat and Chaitanya in Bengal.The worldwide ISKON movement is an outcome of the efforts of the followers of Chaitanya (Kamath 2001, p156) Another wave of devotion (''bhakti'') in the 17th century&ndash;18th century found inspiration in his teachings.Shiva Prakash (1997), pp200&ndash;201
