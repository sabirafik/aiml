Bart's voice is provided by Nancy Cartwright, who voices several other child characters on ''The Simpsons'', including Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, and Kearney.Richmond, pp. 178–179 While the roles of Homer and Marge were given to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner because they were already a part of ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' cast, the producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Yeardley Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled, "I always sounded too much like a girl. I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'" Smith was given the role of Lisa instead. On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of Lisa. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the "middle child" and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was described as "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent,  clever".Cartwright, pp. 35–40 Matt Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot. Cartwright is the only one of the six main ''Simpsons'' cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show.Turner, p. 21

Cartwright's normal speaking voice is said to have "no obvious traces of Bart". The voice came naturally to Cartwright; prior to ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', she had used elements of it in shows such as ''My Little Pony'', ''Snorks'', and ''Pound Puppies''. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform, saying, "Some characters take a little bit more effort, upper respiratory control, whatever it is technically. But Bart is easy to do. I can just slip into that without difficulty." She traditionally does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with. In flashforward episodes, Cartwright still provides the voice of Bart. For "Lisa's Wedding", (season six, 1995) Bart's voice was electronically lowered.Mirkin, David. (2005). Commentary for "Lisa's Wedding", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' . 20th Century Fox.

Despite Bart's fame, Cartwright is rarely recognized in public. On occasions when she is recognized on the street and asked to perform Bart's voice in front of children, Cartwright will refuse because it "freaks  out". During the first season of ''The Simpsons'', the Fox Network did not allow Cartwright to give interviews because they did not want to publicize that Bart was voiced by a woman.

Until 1998, Cartwright was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute, however, was resolved and Cartwright received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The dispute was resolved a month later, and Cartwright's pay rose to $250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately $400,000 per episode.
