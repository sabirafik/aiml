''Gorgosaurus'' was smaller than ''Tyrannosaurus'' or ''Tarbosaurus'', closer in size to ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Daspletosaurus''. Adults reached 8 or 9 meters (26 to 30 ft) from snout to tail. Paleontologists have estimated full-grown adults to weigh more than 2.4 tonnes (2.7 short tons). The largest known skull measures 99 centimeters (39 in) long, just slightly smaller than that of ''Daspletosaurus''. As in other tyrannosaurids, the skull was large compared to its body size, although chambers within the skull bones and large openings (fenestrae) between bones reduced its weight. ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Gorgosaurus'' share proportionally longer and lower skulls than ''Daspletosaurus'' and other tyrannosaurids. The end of the snout was blunt, and the nasal and parietal bones were fused along the midline of the skull, as in all other members of the family. The eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. A tall crest rose from the lacrimal bone in front of each eye, similar to ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Daspletosaurus''. Differences in the shape of bones surrounding the brain set ''Gorgosaurus'' apart from ''Albertosaurus''.
 
''Gorgosaurus'' teeth were typical of all known tyrannosaurids. The eight premaxillary teeth at the front of the snout were smaller than the rest, closely packed and ''D''-shaped in cross section. In ''Gorgosaurus'', the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary teeth. The rest of the teeth were oval in cross section, rather than blade-like as in most other theropods. Along with the eight premaxillary teeth, ''Gorgosaurus'' had 26 to 30 maxillary teeth and 30 to 34 teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw. This number of teeth is similar to ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Daspletosaurus'' but is fewer than those of ''Tarbosaurus'' or ''Tyrannosaurus''.

''Gorgosaurus'' shared its general body plan with all other tyrannosaurids. Its massive head was perched on the end of an ''S''-shaped neck. In contrast to its large head, its forelimbs were very small. The forelimbs had only two digits, although a third metacarpal is known in some specimens, the vestigial remains of the third digit seen in other theropods. ''Gorgosaurus'' had four digits on each hindlimb, including a small first toe (hallux) which did not contact the ground. Tyrannosaurid hindlimbs were long relative to overall body size compared with other theropods. The largest known ''Gorgosaurus'' femur measured 105 centimeters (41 in) long. In several smaller specimens of ''Gorgosaurus'', the tibia was longer than the femur, a proportion typical of fast-running animals. The two bones were of equal length in the largest specimens. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips.
