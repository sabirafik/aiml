By the end of the 1960s, Coward suffered from arteriosclerosis and, during the run of ''Suite in Three Keys'', he struggled with bouts of memory loss.Hoare, p. 501 This also affected his work in ''The Italian Job'', and he retired from acting immediately afterwards.Lesley, p. 454 He died at his home in Jamaica on 26 March 1973 of heart failure and was buried three days later on the brow of Firefly Hill, Jamaica, overlooking the north coast of the island. A memorial service was held in St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London on 29 May 1973, for which the Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, wrote and delivered a poem in Coward's honour,"We are all here today to thank the Lord for the life of Noel Coward.Noel with two dots over the 'e'And the firm decided downward stroke of the 'l'.We can all see him in our mind's eyeAnd in our mind's earWe can hear the clipped decided voice". (Lesley, p. 481) John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier read verse and Yehudi Menuhin played Bach. On 28 March 1984 a memorial stone was unveiled by the Queen Mother in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey. Thanked by Coward's partner, Graham Payn, for attending, the Queen Mother replied, "I came because he was my friend."Day (2007), p. 725
