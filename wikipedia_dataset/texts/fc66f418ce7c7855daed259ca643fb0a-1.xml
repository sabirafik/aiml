The six-month Guadalcanal campaign began August 7, 1942, when Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands, at the time a colonial possession of the United Kingdom. The landings were meant to deny the islands' use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure them as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major Imperial Japanese military base at Rabaul and support of the Allied New Guinea campaign. The Japanese had occupied Tulagi in May 1942 and began constructing an airfield on Guadalcanal in June 1942.Hogue, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 235–236.

By nightfall on August 8, the 11,000 Allied troops secured Tulagi, the nearby small islands and a Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal (later renamed Henderson Field). Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the "Cactus Air Force" (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the US Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months later increased the number of US troops at Lunga Point to more than 20,000 men.Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 14–15; Miller, ''Guadalcanal:  The First Offensive'', p. 143; Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 338; and Shaw, ''First Offensive'', p. 18.

In response, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th Army, a corps-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant-General Harukichi Hyakutake, with the task of retaking Guadalcanal.  Units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal on August 19 to drive Allied forces from the island. Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 96–99; Dull, ''Imperial Japanese Navy'', p. 225; Miller, ''Guadalcanal:  The First Offensive'', pp. 137–138.

Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island.  Instead, they used warships based at Rabaul and the Shortland Islands. The Japanese warships, mainly light cruisers or destroyers from the Eighth Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, were usually able to make the round trip down "The Slot" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the "Tokyo Express" by Allied forces and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese. Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 202, 210–211.


The first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917-man force was defeated on August 21 in the Battle of the Tenaru. The next attempt took place from September 12 through September 14, ending in the defeat of the 6,000 men under the command of Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi at the Battle of Edson's Ridge.Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 141–143, 156–158, 228–246, & 681.

In October, the Japanese again tried to recapture Henderson Field by delivering 15,000 more army men, mainly from the 2nd Infantry Division, to Guadalcanal. In addition to delivering the troops and their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese also successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling the approach of the transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on October 14 that heavily damaged the airfield's runways, destroyed half of the CAF's aircraft, and burned most of the available aviation fuel. In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two runways to service and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its pre-bombardment level over the next few weeks.Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 315–3216; Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 171–175; Hough, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 327–328.

The next Japanese attempt to retake the island with the newly arrived troops occurred from October 20 to October 26 and was defeated with heavy losses in the Battle for Henderson Field.Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', 337–367.  At the same time, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (the commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet) defeated U.S. naval forces in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, driving them away from the area. The Japanese carriers, however, were also forced to retreat because of losses to carrier aircraft and aircrews.Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', 134–135. Thereafter, Yamamoto's ships returned to their main bases at Truk in Micronesia, where he had his headquarters, and Rabaul while three carriers returned to Japan for repairs and refitting.Hammel, ''Guadalcanal:  Decision at Sea'', p. 44–45.

The Japanese army planned another attack on Guadalcanal in November 1942, but further reinforcements were needed before the operation could proceed. The army requested assistance from Yamamoto to deliver the needed reinforcements to the island and to support their planned offensive on the Allied forces guarding Henderson Field. To support the reinforcement effort, Yamamoto provided 11 large transport ships to carry 7,000 army troops from the 38th Infantry Division, their ammunition, food, and heavy equipment from Rabaul to Guadalcanal. He also sent a warship support force from Truk on November 9 that included two battleships. The two battleships, ''Hiei'' and ''Kirishima'', equipped with special fragmentation shells, were to bombard Henderson Field on the night of November 12–13 and destroy it and the aircraft stationed there in order to allow the slow, heavy transports to reach Guadalcanal and unload safely the next day. Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 225–238; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal:  Decision at Sea'', p. 41–46.  The eleven transport ships provided to carry the troops, equipment, and provisions included ''Arizona Maru'', ''Kumagawa Maru'', ''Sado Maru'', ''Nagara Maru'', ''Nako Maru'', ''Canberra Maru'', ''Brisbane Maru'', ''Kinugawa Maru'', ''Hirokawa Maru'', ''Yamaura Maru'', and ''Yamatsuki Maru''.  The warship force was commanded from ''Hiei'' by recently-promoted Vice Admiral Hiroaki Abe. Hammel, ''Guadalcanal:  Decision at Sea'', p. 93.


Because of the constant threat by Japanese aircraft and warships, it was difficult for Allied forces to resupply their forces on Guadalcanal, who were often under attack from Japanese land and sea forces in the area.Hammel, ''Guadalcanal:  Decision at Sea'', p. 28.  In early November 1942, Allied intelligence learned that the Japanese were preparing again to try to retake Henderson Field.Hammel, ''Guadalcanal:  Decision at Sea'', p. 37. Therefore, the U.S. sent Task Force 67, a large reinforcement and resupply convoy, split into two groups and commanded by Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner, to Guadalcanal on November 11. The supply ships were protected by two task groups, commanded by Rear Admirals Daniel J. Callaghan and Norman Scott, and aircraft from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal.Kilpatrick, ''Naval Night Battles'', p. 79–80; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal:  Decision at Sea'', p. 38–39; Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 227–233, 231–233; Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 429–430. The American reinforcements totaled 5,500 men and included the 1st Marine Aviation Engineer Battalion, replacements for ground and air units, the 4th Marine Replacement Battalion, two battalions of the US Army's 182nd Infantry Regiment, and ammunition and supplies. The first transport group, TF 67.1, was commanded by Captain Ingolf N. Kiland and included ''McCawley'', ''Crescent City'', ''President Adams'', and ''President Jackson''.  The second transport group, part of TF 62.4, consisted of ''Betelgeuse'', ''Libra'', and ''Zeilin''. The transport ships were attacked several times on November 11 and November 12 near Guadalcanal by Japanese aircraft based at Buin, Bougainville, in the Solomons, but most were unloaded without serious damage. Twelve Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the U.S. ships or by fighter aircraft flying from Henderson Field. Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 432; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal:  Decision at Sea'', p. 50–90; Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 229–230.
