Two species of ''Iguanodon'' named by Richard Owen have since been reassigned to other genera. ''I. hoggi'' (also spelled ''I. boggii'' or ''hoggii''), named by Owen for a lower jaw from the Tithonian-Berriasian-age Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Purbeck Beds of Dorset in 1874, has been reassigned to ''Camptosaurus'' by David Norman and Paul Barrett, although Paul (2008) and Carpenter and Wilson (2008) have argued against this. ''I. major'', a vertebra from the Isle of Wight described by Owen in 1842 as a species of ''Streptospondylus'', is a ''nomen dubium'' which is now thought to be a synonym of ''I. anglicus'', although it may be its own species.

Other than the two species described by Owen which have been reassigned to other genera, fourteen other species have since been reclassified. ''Iguanodon albinus'' (or ''Albisaurus scutifer''), described by Czech palaeontologist Antonin Fritsch (correctly Frič) in 1893, is a dubious nondinosaurian reptile now known as ''Albisaurus albinus''. ''I. atherfieldensis'', described by R.W. Hooley in 1925, was smaller and less robust than ''I. bernissartensis'', with longer neural spines. It was renamed ''Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis'' in 2007. ''I. exogyrarum'' (also spelled ''I. exogirarum'' or ''I. exogirarus'') was described by Fritsch in 1878. It is a ''nomen dubium'' based on very poor material and has been reassigned, by George Olshevsky, to ''Ponerosteus''. ''I. valdensis'', described by Hulke in 1879 from vertebral and pelvic remains, was from the Barremian stage of the Isle of Wight. Originally named ''Vectisaurus'', it may be a partially grown specimen of ''Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis'',Norman, David B. "A review of ''Vectisaurus valdensis'', with comments on the family Iguanodontidae". ''Dinosaur Systematics'', 147–161. or from an undetermined species of ''Mantellisaurus''. ''I. gracilis'', named by Lydekker in 1888 as the type species of ''Sphenospondylus'' and assigned to ''Iguanodon'' in 1969 by Rodney Steel, may belong to ''Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis''.

''I. foxii'' (also spelled ''I. foxi'') was originally described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 as the type species of ''Hypsilophodon''; Owen (1873 or 1874) reassigned it to ''Iguanodon'', but his assignment was soon overturned.''I. hollingtoniensis'' (also spelled ''I. hollingtonensis''), described by Lydekker in 1889, has been regarded as a synonym of ''I. fittoni'',, although this assessment has not been evaluated in detail.  Another specimen assigned to ''I. hollingtonensis'' by Richard Owen in 1874, with an unusual combination of hadrosaurid-like lower jaw and very robust forelimb, may represent an unnamed taxon. ''I. prestwichii'' (also spelled ''I. prestwichi''), described by John Hulke in 1880, has been reassigned to ''Camptosaurus prestwichii''. ''I. seeleyi'' (also spelled ''I. seelyi''), described by Hulke two years after ''I. prestwichii'', has been synonymised with ''I. bernissartensis'', although this has been disputed. ''I. suessii'', described by Emanuel Bunzel in 1871, has been reassigned to ''Mochlodon suessi''.

''I. lakotaensis'' was described by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork in 1989. The only well-accepted North American species of ''Iguanodon'', ''I. lakotaensis'' was described from a partial skull from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota.  Its assignment has been controversial. Some researchers suggest that it was more basal than ''I. bernissartensis'', and related to ''Theiophytalia'',Brill, Kathleen and Kenneth Carpenter. "A description of a new ornithopod from the Lytle Member of the Purgatoire Formation (Lower Cretaceous) and a reassessment of the skull of ''Camptosaurus''."  ''Horns and Beaks'', 49–67. but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of ''I. bernissartensis''. Gregory S. Paul has since given the species its own genus, ''Dakotadon''.

''Iguanodon mantelli'' (also spelled ''I. manteli'' or ''I. mantellii''), described by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in 1832, is actually based on the same material as ''I. anglicus''. Several skeletons, however, including the Maidstone specimen and one of the Bernissart skeletons have been assigned here over the years, and their attribution is not complete. The gracile Bernissart skeleton, for example, has been reassigned, first to ''Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis'', and upon further review, to its own genus and species, ''Dollodon bampingi''. ''I. orientalis'', described by A. K. Rozhdestvensky in 1952, was based on poor material, but a skull with a distinctive arched snout that had been assigned to it was renamed ''Altirhinus kurzanovi'' in 1998. At the same time, ''I. orientalis'' was considered to be a ''nomen dubium'' indistinguishable from ''I. bernissartensis''. Harry Seeley described ''I. phillipsi'' in 1869, but later reassigned it to ''Priodontognathus''.
