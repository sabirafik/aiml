On July 13, 1787, the Second Continental Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, creating the Northwest Territory which included Michigan. In 1805 the U.S. Congress created the Michigan Territory. Michigan began applying for statehood as early as 1832, though it was rebuffed due to a dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip, a 468-square mile (1,210 kmÂ²) area that included the important port city of Toledo. By 1835, Michigan had formed a state government without receiving authorization from Congress to do so. The boundaries of the state included the contested area.


The dispute culminated in what has become known as the Toledo War, as Michigan and Ohio militia took up arms in the area. As a condition for entering the Union, Michigan was forced to accept the western three quarters of the Upper Peninsula in exchange for ceding its claim to the Toledo Strip. After a state convention first rejected this condition, a second convention, assembled under some duress in December 1836, reluctantly accepted the terms and Michigan became the 26th state on January 26, 1837, with Detroit as its first capital.

The first building to serve as the state capitol was built in 1832 to serve as the "territorial courthouse." This brick structure was one of the earliest Greek revival buildings in Michigan, with a portico of Ionic columns and a central tower of 140 feet (42 m). Built at a cost of $24,500, the building housed the territorial government and state legislatures until 1848, when a hastily-erected wood building was built in Lansing following a decision made March 17, 1847, to move the capital from Detroit to Lansing. The building then became a public school (the Union School, at one time Detroit's only high school) and library until it burned in 1893.
