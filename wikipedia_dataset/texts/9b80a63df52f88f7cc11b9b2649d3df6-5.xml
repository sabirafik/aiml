The Raptors have enjoyed a consistent fanbase throughout their history. From 2000 to 2002, the Raptors led the league in sellouts, but attendances dipped slightly between 2003 and 2006. This improved during the 2006–07 regular season, an average of 18,258 fans attended each game (13th in the league), which translates to 92.2% of the ACC's seating capacity., sports.espn.go.com, accessed 16 June 2007. Following the success of the 2006–07 season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales for the 2007–08 season.Smith, Doug, , thestar.com, 5 September 2007, accessed 6 September 2007.

The value of the Raptors franchise has risen over the years. With the continued popularity of the Raptors, the value of the franchise rose from US$125 million in 1998 to $315 million in 2006, $373 million in 2007, and $400 million in 2008 according to reports by Forbes., forbes.com/lists, 25 January 2007, accessed 15 June 2007., forbes.com, 6 December 2007, accessed 6 February 2008., forbes.com, 3 December 2008, accessed 6 December 2008. The Raptors are also the only NBA team with their own television channel, Raptors NBA TV, a localised version of the league's U.S. channel NBA TV. Their television ratings, however, are considerably lower than other more established Toronto sports teams and other sporting events shown on Canadian television.Zelkovich, Chris, , thestar.com, 30 March 2007, accessed 16 June 2007.

On game day, the fans are usually entertained by the Raptor mascot, the Raptors Dance Pak, and the 4 Korners Raptors Soundcrew during pre-game, time-outs, and intervals. Giveaways are sometimes bundled with tickets to encourage attendance. Further, whenever Toronto scores more than 100 points in a home game, fans can redeem their ticket for a pizza slice at Pizza Pizza locations throughout Ontario. This is part of a promotion made by the Raptor's official pizza sponsor.
