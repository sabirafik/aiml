The conflict between Francis and Henry continued.  The Dauphin's army advanced on Montreuil, forcing Norfolk to raise the siege; Henry himself returned to England at the end of September 1544, ordering Norfolk and Suffolk to defend Boulogne.Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 395–396.  The two dukes quickly disobeyed this order and withdrew the bulk of the English army to Calais, leaving some 4,000 men to defend the captured city.Phillips, "Testing the 'Mystery'", 47; Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 396–397.  The English army, outnumbered, was now trapped in Calais; the Dauphin, left unopposed, concentrated his efforts on besieging Boulogne.Elton, ''England Under the Tudors'', 195; Phillips, "Testing the 'Mystery'", 47, 51–52; Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 397.  On 9 October, a French assault nearly captured the city, but was beaten back when the troops prematurely turned to looting.Arnold, ''Renaissance at War'', 180; Phillips, "Testing the 'Mystery'", 48–50.  Peace talks were attempted at Calais without result; Henry refused to consider returning Boulogne, and insisted that Francis abandon his support of the Scots.Knecht, ''Renaissance Warrior'', 501; Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 397–398.  Charles, who had been appointed as a mediator between Francis and Henry, was meanwhile drawn into his own disputes with the English king.Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 398–399.

Francis now embarked on a more dramatic attempt to force Henry's hand—an attack on England itself.  For this venture, an army of more than 30,000 men was assembled in Normandy, and a fleet of some 400 vessels prepared at Le Havre, all under the command of Claude d'Annebault.Knecht, ''Renaissance Warrior'', 502; Phillips, "Testing the 'Mystery'", 50–51.  Although d'Annebault bore the title of "Admiral", he had no experience in naval warfare.  On 31 May 1545, a French expeditionary force landed in Scotland.Knecht, ''Renaissance Warrior'', 501–502.  In early July, the English under John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, mounted an attack on the French fleet, but had little success due to poor weather; nevertheless, the French suffered from a string of accidents: d'Annebault's first flagship burned, and his second ran aground.Knecht, ''Renaissance Warrior'', 502.  Finally leaving Le Havre on 16 July, the massive French fleet entered the Solent on 19 July and briefly engaged the English fleet, to no apparent effect; the major casualty of the skirmish, the ''Mary Rose'', sank accidentally.Elton, ''England Under the Tudors'', 195; Knecht, ''Renaissance Warrior'', 502; Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 401.  The French landed on the Isle of Wight on 21 July, and again at Seaford on 25 July, but these operations were abortive, and the French fleet soon returned to blockading Boulogne.Knecht, ''Renaissance Warrior'', 502; Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', 401–402.  D'Annebault made a final sortie near Beachy Head on 15 August, but retired to port after a brief skirmish.Knecht, ''Renaissance Warrior'', 502.
