Since the beginning of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors,R. Byron, ''Greco: The Epilogue to Byzantine Culture'', 160–174* A. Procopiou, ''El Greco and Cretan Painting'', 74 while others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work.M.B Cossío, ''El Greco'', 501–512

The discovery of the ''Dormition of the Virgin'' on Syros, an authentic and signed work from the painter's Cretan period, and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s, contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories. Although following many conventions of the Byzantine icon, aspects of the style certainly show Venetian influence, and the composition, showing the death of Mary, combines the different doctrines of the Orthodox Dormition of the Virgin and the Catholic Assumption of the Virgin.Robin Cormack (1997),199 Significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work, including his supposed Byzantinism.Cormack-Vfassilaki,  Based on the notes written in El Greco's own hand, on his unique style, and on the fact that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters, they see an organic continuity between Byzantine painting and his art.R.M. Helm, ''The Neoplatonic Tradition in the Art of El Greco'', 93–94* A.L. Mayer, ''El Greco—An Oriental Artist'', 146 According to Marina Lambraki-Plaka "far from the influence of Italy, in a neutral place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace, Candia, the Byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a catalytic role in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his mature work".M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco, the Puzzle'', 19 In making this judgement, Lambraki-Plaka disagrees with Oxford University professors Cyril Mango and Elizabeth Jeffreys, who assert that "despite claims to the contrary, the only Byzantine element of his famous paintings was his signature in Greek lettering".Mango-Jeffreys, ''Towards a Franco—Greek Culture'', 305 Nikos Hadjinikolaou states that from 1570 El Greco's painting is "neither Byzantine nor post-Byzantine but Western European. The works he produced in Italy belong to the history of the Italian art, and those he produced in Spain to the history of Spanish art".N. Hadjinikolaou, ''El Greco, 450 Years from his Birth'', 92



The English art historian David Davies seeks the roots of El Greco's style in the intellectual sources of his Greek-Christian education and in the world of his recollections from the liturgical and ceremonial aspect of the Orthodox Church. Davies believes that the religious climate of the Counter-Reformation and the aesthetics of mannerism acted as catalysts to activate his individual technique. He asserts that the philosophies of Platonism and ancient Neo-Platonism, the works of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco's style.D. Davies, "The Influence of Neo-Platonism on El Greco", 20 etc.* D. Davies, ''the Byzantine Legacy in the Art of El Greco'', 425–445 Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue, José Álvarez Lopera, curator at the Museo del Prado, Madrid, concludes that the presence of "Byzantine memories" is obvious in El Greco's mature works, though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination.J.A. Lopera, ''El Greco: From Crete to Toledo'', 18–19
