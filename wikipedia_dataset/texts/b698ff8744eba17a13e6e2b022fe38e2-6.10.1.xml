As a hadrosaurid, ''Edmontosaurus'' was a large terrestrial herbivore. Its teeth were continually replaced and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time.  It used its broad beak to cut loose food, perhaps by cropping, or by closing the jaws in a clamshell-like manner over twigs and branches and then stripping off the more nutritious leaves and shoots. Because the tooth rows are deeply indented from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is inferred that ''Edmontosaurus'' and most other ornithischians had cheek-like structures, muscular or non-muscular. The function of the cheeks was to retain food in the mouth.Fastovsky, D.E., and Smith, J.B. (2004). "Dinosaur paleoecology." ''The Dinosauria''. pp. 614â€“626.  The animal's feeding range would have been from ground level to around  above. 

Before the 1960s and 1970s, the prevailing interpretation of hadrosaurids like ''Edmontosaurus'' was that they were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.

The prevailing model of how hadrosaurids fed was put forward in 1984 by David B. Weishampel.  He proposed that the structure of the skull permitted motion between bones that led to backward and forward motion of the lower jaw, and outward bowing of the tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed.  The teeth of the upper jaw would grind against the teeth of the lower jaw like rasps, processing plant material trapped between them. Such a motion would parallel the effects of mastication in mammals, although accomplishing the effects in a completely different way. An important piece of evidence for Weishampel's model is the orientation of scratches on the teeth, showing the direction of jaw action. Other movements could produce similar scratches, though, such as movement of the bones of the two halves of the lower jaw. Not all models have been scrutinized under present techniques.

Weishampel developed his model with the aid of a computer simulation. Natalia Rybczynski and colleagues have updated this work with a much more sophisticated three-dimensional animation model, scanning a skull of ''E. regalis'' with lasers.  They were able to replicate the proposed motion with their model, although they found that additional secondary movements between other bones were required, with maximum separations of  between some bones during the chewing cycle. Rybczynski and colleagues were not convinced that the Weishampel model is viable, but noted that they have several improvements to implement to their animation.  Planned improvements include incorporating soft tissue and tooth wear marks and scratches, which should better constrain movements. They note that there are several other hypotheses to test as well. Further work by Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer found that ornithopods like ''Edmontosaurus'' lacked the types of skull joints seen in those modern animals that are known to have kinetic skulls (skulls that permit motion between their constituent bones), such as squamates and birds.  They proposed that joints that had been interpreted as permitting movement in dinosaur skulls were actually cartilaginous growth zones.

The immobile skull model was challenged in 2009 by Vincent Williams and colleagues.  Returning to tooth microwear, they found four classes of scratches on ''Edmontosaurus'' teeth.  The most common class was interpreted as resulting from an oblique motion, not a simple up-down or front-back motion, which is more consistent with the Weishampel model.  This motion is thought to have been the primary motion for grinding food.  Two scratch classes were interpreted as resulting from forward or backward movement of the jaws.  The other class was variable and probably resulted from opening the jaws.  The combination of movements is more complex than had been previously predicted.  Because scratches dominate the microwear texture, Williams ''et al.'' suggested ''Edmontosaurus'' was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials.  Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding at ground level.

Reports of gastroliths, or stomach stones, in the hadrosaurid ''Claosaurus'' are actually based on a probable double misidentification.  First, the specimen is actually of ''Edmontosaurus annectens''.  Barnum Brown, who discovered the specimen in 1900, referred to it as ''Claosaurus'' because ''E. annectens'' was thought to be a species of ''Claosaurus'' at the time.  Additionally, it is more likely that the supposed gastroliths represent gravel washed in during burial.
