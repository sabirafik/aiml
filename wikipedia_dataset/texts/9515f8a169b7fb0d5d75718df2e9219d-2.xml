The family returned to London in 1887. In 1890, Yeats co-founded the Rhymers' Club with Ernest Rhys,Hone (1943), 83 a group of London based poets who met regularly in a Fleet Street tavern to recite their verse. The collective later became known as the "Tragic Generation"Alford, Norman. "The Rhymers' Club: Poets of the Tragic Generation". ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Vol. 50, No. 4, March 1996. 535–538 and published two anthologies: first in 1892 and again in 1894. He collaborated with Edwin Ellis on the first complete edition of William Blake's works, in the process rediscovering a forgotten poem "Vala, or, the Four Zoas."Lancashire, Ian. "".

In a late essay on Shelley, Yeats wrote, "I have re-read ''Prometheus Unbound''... and it seems to me to have an even more certain place than I had thought among the sacred books of the world."Yeats (1900), 65

Yeats had a life-long interest in mysticism, spiritualism, occultism, and astrology. He read extensively on the subjects throughout his life, became a member of the paranormal research organization "The Ghost Club" (in 1911) and was especially influenced by the writings of Emanuel SwedenborgBurke, Martin J. "". Columbia University, 7 October 2005. Retrieved on 15 July 2007.. As early as 1892, he wrote: "If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book, nor would ''The Countess Kathleen'' ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all that I write."Ellmann, Richard (1948). "Yeats: The Man and the Masks". (New York) Macmillan. 94 His mystical interests&mdash;also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee, and the occult&mdash;formed much of the basis of his late poetry. However, some critics have dismissed these influences as lacking in intellectual credibility. 
In particular, W. H. Auden criticized this aspect of Yeats' work as the "deplorable spectacle of a grown man occupied with the mumbo-jumbo of magic and the nonsense of India."Mendelson, Edward (Ed.)

Yeats' first significant poem was "The Isle of Statues", a fantasy work that took Edmund Spenser for its poetic model. The piece appeared in ''Dublin University Review'', but has not since been republished. His first solo publication was the pamphlet ''Mosada: A Dramatic Poem'' (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection ''The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems'' (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long titular poem contains, in the words of his biographer R.F. Foster, "obscure Gaelic names, striking repetitions  an unremitting rhythm subtly varied as the poem proceeded through its three sections".Foster (1997), 82–85
We rode in sorrow, with strong hounds three,Bran, Sgeolan, and Lomair,On a morning misty and mild and fair.The mist-drops hung on the fragrant trees,And in the blossoms hung the bees.We rode in sadness above Lough Lean,For our best were dead on Gavra's green.



"The Wanderings of Oisin" is based on the lyrics of the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology and displays the influence of both Sir Samuel Ferguson and the Pre-Raphaelite poets.Alspach, Russell K. "The Use by Yeats and Other Irish Writers of the Folklore of Patrick Kennedy". ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Volume 59, No. 234, December 1946. 404-412 The poem took two years to complete and was one of the few works from this period that he did not disown in his maturity. ''Oisin'' introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include ''Poems'' (1895), ''The Secret Rose'' (1897), and ''The Wind Among the Reeds'' (1899).

During 1885, Yeats was involved in the formation of the Dublin Hermetic Order. The society held its first meeting on 16 June, with Yeats acting as its chairman. The same year, the Dublin Theosophical lodge was opened in conjunction with Brahmin Mohini Chatterjee, who travelled from the Theosophical Society in London to lecture. Yeats attended his first séance the following year. He later became heavily involved with the Theosophical Society and with hermeticism, particularly with the eclectic Rosicrucianism of the Golden Dawn. During séances held from 1912, a spirit calling itself "Leo Africanus" apparently claimed to be Yeats' ''Daemon'' or anti-self, inspiring some of the speculations in ''Per Amica Silentia Lunae''.Nally, Claire V. "National Identity Formation in W. B. Yeats' 'A Vision'". ''Irish Studies Review'', Volume 14, Issue 1, February 2006. 57–67 He was admitted into the Golden Dawn in March 1890 and took the magical motto ''Daemon est Deus inversus''&mdash;translated as ''Devil is God inverted'' or ''A demon is a god reflected''.''Daemon est Deus inversus'' is taken from the writings of Madame Blavatsky in which she claims that "...even that divine Homogeneity must contain in itself the essence of both good and evil", and uses the motto as a symbol of the Astral Light. He was an active recruiter for the sect's ''Isis-Urania'' temple, and brought in his uncle George Pollexfen, Maud Gonne, and Florence Farr. Although he reserved a distaste for abstract and dogmatic religions founded around personality cults, he was attracted to the type of people he met at the Golden Dawn.Foster (1997), 103 He was involved in the Order's power struggles, both with Farr and Macgregor Mathers, but was most notably involved when Mathers sent Aleister Crowley to repossess Golden Dawn paraphernalia during the "Battle of Blythe Road". After the Golden Dawn ceased and splintered into various offshoots, Yeats remained with the Stella Matutina until 1921.Cullingford, Elizabeth.
