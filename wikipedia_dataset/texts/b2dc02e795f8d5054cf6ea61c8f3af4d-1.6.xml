In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. Operations such as Roger Corman's New World Pictures, Cannon Films, and New Line Cinema brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country. The major studios' top product was continuing to inflate in running time—in 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes.See Finler (1988), p. 277, for top films. Finler lists ''Hello, Dolly!'' as 1970, when it made most of its money, but it premiered in December 1969. ''The Owl and the Pussycat'', 51 minutes shorter, replaces it in this analysis. The Bs were keeping pace: In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74.8 minutes. He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World: the average length was 89.8 minutes.From 1955: ''Apache Woman'', ''The Beast with a Million Eyes'', ''Day the World Ended'', ''The Fast and the Furious'', and ''Five Guns West''. From 1970: ''Angels Die Hard'', ''Bloody Mama'', ''The Dunwich Horror'', ''Ivanna'' (aka ''Scream of the Demon Lover''; U.S. premiere: 1971), and ''The Student Nurses''. For purchase of ''Ivanna'': Di Franco (1979), p. 164. These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World release, the biker movie ''Angels Die Hard'', cost $117,000 to produce and took in more than $2 million at the box office.Di Franco (1979), p. 160.

The biggest studio in the low-budget field remained a leader in exploitation's growth. In 1973, American International gave a shot to young director Brian De Palma. Reviewing ''Sisters'', Pauline Kael observed that its "limp technique doesn't seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore.... e can't get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938."Kael (1976), p. 269. Many examples of the so-called blaxploitation genre, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's ''Beyond the Valley of the Dolls'' (1970). Several New World pictures followed, including ''The Big Doll House'' (1971) and ''The Big Bird Cage'' (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: ''Coffy'' (1973) and ''Foxy Brown'' (1974). Grier has the distinction of starring in the first widely distributed movie to climax with a castration scene.

Blaxploitation was the first exploitation genre in which the major studios were central. Indeed, the United Artists release ''Cotton Comes to Harlem'' (1970), directed by Ossie Davis, is seen as the first significant film of the type. But the movie that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent: ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' (1971) is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form: wildly experimental, borderline pornographic, and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. Melvin Van Peebles wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with a loan from Bill Cosby.Van Peebles (2003). Its distributor was small Cinemation Industries, then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian ''Mondo Cane'' "shockumentaries" and the Swedish skin flick ''Fanny Hill'', as well as for its one in-house production, ''The Man from O.R.G.Y.'' (1970). These sorts of films played in the "grindhouses" of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema. The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.

In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16 mm by first-time American director Barbara Loden won the international critics' prize at the Venice Film Festival. ''Wanda'' is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir. The sub-$200,000 production, for which Loden spent six years raising money, was praised by Vincent Canby for "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and...purity of technique."Quoted in Reynaud (2006). See Reynaud also for Loden's fundraising efforts. For production cost: Schickel (2005), p. 432. See also  essay by Bérénice Reynaud, 2002 (1995); part of the ''Sense of Cinema'' website. Retrieved 12/29/06. Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by Larry Cohen, ''Bone'' (1972), ''Black Caesar'' (1973), and ''Hell Up in Harlem'' (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. The gory horror film ''Deathdream'' (1974), directed by Bob Clark, is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: ''Shivers'' (1975), ''Rabid'' (1977), ''The Brood'' (1979). An ''Easy Rider'' with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists' biker-themed ''Electra Glide in Blue'' (1973), directed by James William Guercio.See, e.g., Tom Milne, "''Electra Glide in Blue''," in ''Time Out Film Guide'', 8th ed., ed. John Pym (London et al.: Penguin, 1999), p. 303. ''The New York Times'' reviewer thought little of it: "Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio."Greenspun (1973).

In the early 1970s, the growing practice of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, with the goal of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip.See, e.g., Jack Stevenson, ''Land of a Thousand Balconies: Discoveries and Confessions of a B-Movie Archaeologist'' (Manchester, UK: Headpress/Critical Vision, 2003), pp. 49–50; Joanne Hollows, "The Masculinity of Cult," in ''Defining Cult Movies: The Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste'', ed. Mark Jancovich (Manchester, UK, and New York: Manchester University Press, 2003), pp. 35–53; Janet Staiger, ''Blockbuster TV: Must-see Sitcoms in the Network Era'' (New York and London: New York University Press, 2000), p. 112. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old ''Night of the Living Dead''. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside of the studio system, like John Waters's ''Pink Flamingos'' (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century-Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as ''Rocky Horror'' generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.

Asian martial arts films began appearing as imports regularly during the 1970s. These "kung fu" films as they were often called, whatever martial art they featured, were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kong–produced movies of Bruce Lee and marketed to the same audience targeted by AIP and New World. Horror continued to attract young, independent American directors. As Roger Ebert explained in one 1974 review, "Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they're brought in at the right price. So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can't get more conventional projects off the ground."Ebert (1974). The movie under consideration was ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre''. Made by Tobe Hooper for no more than $250,000, it became one of the most influential horror films of the 1970s.For the film's cost: Rockoff (2002), p. 42. For its influence: Sapolsky and Molitor (1996), p. 36; Rubin (1999), p. 155. John Carpenter's ''Halloween'' (1978), produced on a $320,000 budget, grossed over $80 million worldwide and effectively established the slasher flick as horror's primary mode for the next decade. Just as Hooper had learned from Romero's work, ''Halloween'', in turn, largely followed the model of ''Black Christmas'' (1974), directed by ''Deathdream'''s Bob Clark.For the film's cost and worldwide gross: Harper (2004), pp. 12–13. For its influence and debt to ''Black Christmas'': Rockoff (2002); Paul (1994), p. 320.

On television, the parallels between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded with the introduction of the ''ABC Movie of the Week'' in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as ''The Ordeal of Patty Hearst'', which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as ''Human Wreckage'' and ''When Love Grows Cold'', FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as ''The California Kid'' (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. ''Nightmare in Badham County'' (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.

The reverberations of ''Easy Rider'' could be felt in such pictures, as well as in a host of big-screen exploitation films. But its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less direct. By 1973, the major studios were catching on to the commercial potential of genres once largely consigned to the bargain basement. ''Rosemary's Baby'' had been a big hit, but it had little in common with the exploitation style. Warner Bros.' ''The Exorcist'' demonstrated that a heavily promoted horror film could be an absolute blockbuster: it was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest-earning horror movie yet made. In William Paul's description, it is also "the film that really established gross-out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema.... ast exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality. ''The Exorcist'' made cruelty respectable. By the end of the decade, the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice."Paul (1994), pp. 288, 291. Writer-director George Lucas's ''American Graffiti'', a Universal production, did something similar. Described by Paul as "essentially an American-International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish," it was 1973's third biggest film and, likewise, by far the highest-earning teen-themed movie yet made.Paul (1994), p. 92. Even more historically significant movies with B themes and A-level financial backing would follow in their wake.
