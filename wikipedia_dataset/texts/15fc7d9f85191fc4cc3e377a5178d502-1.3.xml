Harihara (or Harisvara, 1160), who came from a family of ''karnikas'' (accountants) in Hampi, was one of the earliest Veerashaiva writers who was not part of the ''Vachana'' poetic tradition. He is considered one of the most influential Kannada poets of the Hoysala era. A non-traditionalist, he has been called "poet of poets" and a "poet for the masses". Kannada poetry changed course because of his efforts, and he was an inspiration for generations of poets to follow.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 191Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1411&ndash;1412, p. 1550 Impressed by his early writings, Kereya Padmarasa, the court poet of King Narasimha I, introduced him to the king, who became Harihara's patron.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1548 A master of many metres, he authored the ''Girijakalyana'' ("Marriage of the mountain born goddess &ndash; Parvati") in the Kalidasa tradition, employing the ''champu'' style to tell a 10-part story leading to the marriage of the god Shiva and Parvati.Sastri (1955), pp. 361&ndash;362Narasimhacharya, (1988), p. 20 According to an anecdote, Harihara was so against eulogising earthly mortals that he struck his protege Raghavanka for writing about King Harishchandra in the landmark work ''Harishchandra Kavya'' (c. 1200).Nagara (2003), p. 364 Harihara is credited with developing the native ''ragale'' metre.Sahitya Akademi (1987), pp. 551&ndash;552 The earliest poetic biographer in the Kannada language, he wrote a biography of Basavanna called ''Basavarajadevara ragale'', which gives interesting details about the protagonist while not always conforming to popular beliefs of the time.Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 179Sahitya Akademi (1987), pp. 403&ndash;404 Ascribed to him is a group of 100 poems called the ''Nambiyanana ragale'' (also called ''Shivaganada ragale'' or ''Saranacharitamanasa'' &ndash; "The holy lake of the lives of the devotees") after the saint Nambiyana.Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 205Sastri (1955), pp. 361&ndash;362Rice E. P. (1921), p. 60 In the ''sataka'' metre he wrote the ''Pampa sataka'', and in the ''ashtaka'' metre, the ''Mudige ashtaka'' in about 1200.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 248

Famous among Vaishnava writers and the first brahmin writer (of the Smartha sect) of repute, Rudrabhatta wrote ''Jagannatha Vijaya'' (1180) in a style considered a transition between ancient and medieval Kannada.Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 203 Chandramouli, a minister in the court of King Veera Ballala II, was his patron. The writing, in ''champu'' metre, is about the life of the god Krishna. Leading to the god's fight with Banasura, it is based on an earlier writing, ''Vishnupurana''.Sastri (1955) p.  364 

Nemichandra, court poet of King Veera Ballala II and the Silhara King Lakshmana of Kholapur, wrote ''Lilavati Prabandham'' (1170), the earliest available true fiction (and hence a novel) in Kannada, with an erotic bent.Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 203 Written in the ''champu'' metre, with the ancient town Banavasi as the background, it narrates the love story of a Kadamba prince and a princess who eventually marry after facing many obstacles. The story is based on a c. 610 Sanskrit original called ''Vasavadatta'' by Subhandu.Rice E. P. (1921), p. 43 His other work, ''Neminathapurana'', unfinished on account of his death (and hence called ''Ardhanemi'' or "incomplete Nemi"), details the life of the 22nd Jain tirthankar Neminatha while treating the life of the god Krishna from a Jain angle.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 620; (1988), p. 1180   

Palkuriki Somanatha, a native of modern Karnataka or Andhra Pradesh, is considered one of the foremost multi-lingual Shaiva (or Shiva-following) poets of the 12th and 13th centuries. Historians are divided about the time and place of his birth and death and his original faith. He was adept in the Sanskrit, Telugu and Kannada languages. He was a devotee of Basavanna (the founder of the Veerashaiva movement), and all his writings propagate that faith.Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4133 It is generally accepted that he was born a brahmin and later adopted the Shaiva faith, although according to the scholar Bandaru Tammayya he was born a ''Jangama'' (follower of the Shaiva faith).Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4133 His time of birth has been identified as either the 12th centuryNarasimhacharya (1988), p. 20 or late 13th century.Seshayya in Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4133 In Kannada, his most important writings are ''Silasampadane'', ''Sahasragananama'' and ''Pancharatna''. His well-known poems, written in the ''ragale'' metre, are ''Basava ragale'', ''Basavadhya ragale'' and ''Sadguru ragale''.  He is known to have humbled many Vaishnava poets in debates.Sastri (1955), p. 362

Other well-known personalities from the 12th century included several Jain writers. These include Aggala, who authored ''Chandraprabhapurana'' (1189), an account of the life of the eighth Jain tirthankar Chandraprabha; Sujanottamsa, who wrote a panegyric on Gomateshwara of Shravanabelagola; and Vritta Vilasa, who authored ''Sastra sara'' and ''Dharmaparikshe'' (1160). The latter was Vilasa's version of the Sanskrit original of the same name written by Amitagati c. 1014. In this ''champu'' writing, the author narrates the story of two Kshatriya princess who went to Benares and exposed the vices of the gods after discussions with the brahmins there. The author questions the credibility of Hanuman (the Hindu monkey god) and the Vanaras (monkey-like humanoids in the Hindu epic Ramayana). Although controversial, the work sheds useful information on contemporary religious beliefs.Rice B. L. (1897), p. 499Rice E. P. (1921), pp. 37 Kereya Padmarasa, a Veerashaiva poet patronised by King Narasimha I, wrote ''Dikshabodhe'' in the ''ragale'' metre in 1165. He would later become the protagonist of a biographical work called ''Padmarajapurana'' written by his descendant Padmanaka in c. 1400.Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4003 The brahmin poet Deva Kavi authored a romance piece called ''Kusumavali'' (1200), and brahmin poet Kavi Kama (12th century) authored a treatise called ''Sringara-ratnakara''  on the ''rasa'' (flavor) of poetical sentiment.Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 20, 62 Sumanobana (1170) was a poet-grammarian  and the ''Katakacharya'' ("military teacher") under King Narasimha I. He was also a priest in Devagiri, the Seuna Yadava capital.Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1475&ndash;1476
