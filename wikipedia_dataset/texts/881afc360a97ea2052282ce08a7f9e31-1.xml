President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933In the  November 1932 parliamentary elections, the Nazi Party won 196 seats in the Reichstag out of a possible 584. The Nazis were the largest party in the legislature but were still considerably short of a majority.. Over the next few months, during the so-called Gleichschaltung, Hitler dispensed with the need for the  Reichstag as a  legislative bodyThrough the Enabling Act of 1933 Hitler arrogated the nation's legislative power and was thereafter effectively able to rule through promulgation of decrees that avoided the  legislative processes of the Weimar Constitution and eliminated all rival political parties in Germany so that by the middle of 1933, the country had become a one-party state under his direction and control. However, despite his swift consolidation of political authority, Hitler did not exercise absolute power. As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a highly respected veteran Field Marshal, albeit increasingly frail and senile. While many officers were impressed by Hitler's promises of an expanded army, a return to conscription, and a more aggressive foreign policy, the army continued to guard its traditions of independence during the early years of the Nazi regime.

To a lesser extent, the  (SA), a Nazi paramilitary organization, remained somewhat autonomous within the party itself. The SA evolved out of the remnants of the Freikorps movement of the post-WWI years. The Freikorps were nationalistic organizations primarily composed of disaffected, disenchanted and angry German combat veterans who believed that their government had betrayed Germany and sold them out by surrendering and submitting to the humiliating terms of the Versailles Treaty. The Freikorps were in opposition to the new Weimar Republic. Ernst Röhm was commander of the Bavarian Freikorps and was given the nickname "The Machine Gun King of Bavaria" because he was responsible for storing and issuing illegal machine guns to Freikorps units in Bavaria. He later became commander of the SA. During the 1920s and 1930s, the SA functioned as a private militia that Hitler used to intimidate rivals and disrupt the meetings of competing political parties, especially those of the Social Democrats and the Communists. Also known as the "brownshirts" or "stormtroopers", the SA became notorious for their street battles with the Communists.Reiche (2002), pp. 120–121. The violent confrontations between the two groups contributed to the destabilization of Germany's inter-war experiment with democracy, the Weimar Republic.Toland (1976), p. 266. In June 1932, one of the worst months of political violence, there were over 400 street battles, resulting in 82 deaths. Shirer (1960), p. 165. This very destabilization had been crucial in Hitler's rise to power, however, not least because it convinced many Germans that once Hitler became chancellor, the endemic street violence would end.

Hitler's appointment as chancellor, followed by the suppression of all political parties except the Nazis, curtailed but did not end the violence of the stormtroopers. Deprived of Communist party meetings to disrupt, but inured to and seduced by violence, the stormtroopers would sometimes run riot in German streets after a night of drinking. Very often they would beat up passers-by, and then attack the police who were called to stop them.Evans (2005), p. 23. Complaints of "overbearing and loutish" behavior by stormtroopers were common by the middle of 1933. Even the Foreign Office complained of instances of brownshirts manhandling foreign diplomats.Kershaw, ''Hitler'', (1999), p. 501 Such behavior disturbed the German middle classes and other conservative elements in society, such as the army.

Hitler's next move would be to strengthen his position with the army by moving against its nemesis, the SA.Kershaw, ''Hitler'', (1999), p. 435 On July 6, 1933, at a gathering of high-ranking Nazi officials, Hitler declared the success of the National Socialist, or Nazi revolution. Now that the NSDAP had seized the reins of power in Germany, he said, it was time to consolidate its hold. As Hitler told the gathered officials, "The stream of revolution has been undammed, but it must be channeled into the secure bed of evolution."Evans (2005), p. 20.

Hitler's speech signaled his intention to rein in the SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be a simple task, however, as the SA constituted a large part of the most devoted followers of Nazism. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many Germans lost their jobs and faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively or even primarily a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many workers for both class solidarity and nationalist fervor.Schoenbaum, (1997) pp. 35–42. "The most general theory—that National Socialism was a revolution of the lower middle class—is defensible but inadequate." Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. That the regime did not take such steps disillusioned those who expected an economic as well as a political revolution.Bullock (1958), p. 80. "But in origin the National Socialists had been a radical anti-capitalist party, and this part of the National Socialist programme was not only taken seriously by many loyal Party members but was of increasing importance in a period of economic depression. How seriously Hitler took the socialist character of National Socialism was to remain one of the main causes of disagreement and division within the Nazi party up to the summer of 1934."
