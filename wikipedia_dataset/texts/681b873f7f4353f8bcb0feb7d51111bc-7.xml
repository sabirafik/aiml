In 1879 Smetana had written to a friend, the Czech poet Jan Neruda, revealing fears of the onset of madness.Large, pp. 370–72 By the winter of 1882–83 he was experiencing depression, insomnia, and hallucinations, together with giddiness, cramp and a temporary loss of speech. In 1883 he began writing  a new symphonic suite, ''Prague Carnival'', but could get no further than an Introduction and a Polonaise.Clapham (1972), pp. 54–56 He started  a new opera, ''Viola'', based on the character in Shakespeare's ''Twelfth Night'',Newmarch, p. 89 but wrote only fragments as  his mental state gradually deteriorated. In October 1883 his behaviour at a private reception in Prague disturbed his friends; by the middle of February 1884 he had ceased to be coherent, and was periodically violent.Large, pp. 390–94 On 23 April his family, unable to nurse him any longer, removed him to the Kateřinky Lunatic Asylum in Prague, where he died on 12 May 1884.

The hospital registered the cause of death as senile dementia. However, Smetana's family believed that his physical and mental decline was due to syphilis. An analysis of the autopsy report, published by the German neurologist Dr Ernst Levin in 1972, came to the same conclusion.Clapham (1972), p. 151 Tests carried out by Prof. Emanuel  Vlček in the late 20th century on samples of muscular tissue from Smetana's exhumed body provided further evidence of the disease. However, this research has been challenged  by Czech physician Dr Jiří Ramba, who has argued that Vlček's tests do not provide a basis for a reliable conclusion, citing the age and state of the tissues and highlighting reported symptoms of Smetana's that were incompatible with syphilis.   

Smetana's funeral took place on 15 May, at the Týn Church in Prague's Old Town. The subsequent procession to the Vyšehrad Cemetery was led by members of the Hlahol, bearing torches, and was followed by a large crowd. The grave later became a place of pilgrimage for musical visitors to Prague.Newmarch, p. 90 On the funeral evening, at the National Theatre, a scheduled performance at the National Theatre of ''The Bartered Bride'' was allowed to proceed, the stage draped with black cloth as a mark of respect.

Smetana was survived by Bettina, their daughters Zdeňka and Božena, and by Žofie.  None of them played any significant role in Smetana's musical life. Bettina lived until 1908; Žofie, who had married Josef Schwarz in 1874, predeceased her mother, dying in 1902.Large, p. 395 The younger daughters eventually married, living out their lives away from the public eye. A permanent memorial to Smetana's life and work is the Smetana Museum in Prague, originally founded in 1926 within the Charles University's Institute for Musicology.  In 1936 the museum moved to the former Waterworks building on the banks of the Vltava, and since 1976 has been part of the Czech Museum of Music.
