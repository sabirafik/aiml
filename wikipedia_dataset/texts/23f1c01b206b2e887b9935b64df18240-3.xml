Albert Edward and Alexandra visited Ireland in April 1868. After her illness the previous year, she had only just begun to walk again without the aid of two walking sticks, and was already pregnant with her fourth child.Battiscombe, p. 94 They undertook a six-month tour taking in Austria, Egypt and Greece over 1868–9, which included visits to her brother, King George I of Greece, the Crimean battlefields and, for her only, the harem of the Khedive Ismail. In Turkey she became the first woman to sit down to dinner with the Sultan (Abdülâziz).Duff, pp. 93–100

Albert Edward and Alexandra made Sandringham House their preferred residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage was in many ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation.Duff, p. 111 and Philip Magnus quoted in Battiscombe, pp. 109–110 This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift.Battiscombe, p. 110 Nevertheless, Edward was severely criticized from many quarters of society for his apparent disinterest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever.Hough, pp. 132-134 Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, among them the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Most of these were with the full knowledge of Alexandra, who later invited Alice Keppel to visit the King as he lay dying.Battiscombe, p. 271 and Priestley, p. 18 and 180 Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.Battiscombe, pp. 100–101

An increasing degree of deafness, caused by hereditary otosclerosis, led to Alexandra's social isolation; she spent more time at home with her children and pets.Battiscombe, p. 88 and Duff, p. 82 Her sixth and final pregnancy ended in tragedy when her infant son died after only a day of life. Despite Alexandra's pleas for privacy, Queen Victoria insisted on announcing a period of court mourning, which led to unsympathetic elements of the press to describe the birth as "a wretched abortion" and the funeral arrangements as "sickening mummery".Duff, p. 85



For eight months over 1875–6, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain on a tour of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The Prince had planned an all-male group and intended to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the Prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by his wife that she was going to leave him for another man: Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the Queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The Prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.Battiscombe, pp. 132–135

Alexandra spent the spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of the Hellenes.Battiscombe, p. 136 During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where her sister was married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a revision of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks.Battiscombe, pp. 150–152 Alexandra and her two sons spent the next three years largely parted from each other's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them dreadfully.Battiscombe, pp. 155–156 In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to Saint Petersburg after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide comfort to her sister, who was now the Tsarina.Battiscombe, pp. 157–160 and Duff, p. 131

Alexandra undertook many public duties; in the words of Queen Victoria, "to spare me the strain and fatigue of functions. She opens bazaars, attends concerts, visits hospitals in my place ... she not only never complains, but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty."Queen Victoria quoted in Duff, p. 146 She took a particular interest in the London Hospital, visiting it regularly. Joseph Merrick, the so-called "Elephant Man", was one of the patients whom she met.Battiscombe, pp. 257–258 and Duff, pp. 148–151 Crowds usually cheered Alexandra rapturously,Battiscombe, p. 166 but during a visit to Ireland in 1885, she suffered a rare moment of public hostility when visiting the City of Cork, a hotbed of Irish nationalism. She, and her husband, were booed by a crowd of two or three thousand people brandishing sticks and black flags. She smiled her way through the ordeal, and the British press still portrayed the visit in a positive light, describing the crowds as "enthusiastic".''Daily Telegraph'' quoted in Battiscombe, p. 168 As part of the same visit, she received a Doctorate in Music from Trinity College, Dublin.Battiscombe, p. 167

The death of her eldest son, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in 1892 was a serious blow to the tender-hearted Alexandra, and his room and possessions were kept exactly as he had left them, much as those of Prince Albert were left after his death in 1861.Battiscombe, pp. 189–193, 197 and Duff, p. 184 She said, "I have buried my angel and with him my happiness."Alexandra quoted in Duff, p. 186 Surviving letters between Alexandra and her children indicate that they were mutually devoted.Battiscombe, pp. 141–142 In 1894, her brother-in-law, Alexander III of Russia, died and her nephew, Nicholas II of Russia became Tsar. Alexandra's widowed sister, the Dowager Empress Maria, leant heavily on her for support; Alexandra slept, prayed and stayed beside her sister for the next two weeks until Alexander's burial.Battiscombe, p. 205 and Duff, pp. 196–197
