''Lambeosaurus lambei'' and ''L. magnicristatus'', from the Dinosaur Park Formation, were members of a diverse and well-documented fauna of prehistoric animals that included such well-known dinosaurs as the horned ''Centrosaurus'', ''Styracosaurus'', and ''Chasmosaurus'', fellow duckbills ''Prosaurolophus'', ''Gryposaurus'', ''Corythosaurus'', and ''Parasaurolophus'', tyrannosaurid ''Gorgosaurus'', and armored ''Edmontonia'' and ''Euoplocephalus''.Weishampel, David B.; Barrett, Paul M.; Coria, Rodolfo A.; Le Loeuff, Jean; Xu Xing; Zhao Xijin; Sahni, Ashok; Gomani, Elizabeth, M.P.; and Noto, Christopher R. (2004). "Dinosaur Distribution", in ''The Dinosauria'' (2nd), pp. 517–606. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward.Eberth, David A. 2005. "The geology", in ''Dinosaur Provincial Park'', pp. 54–82. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.Braman, Dennis R., and Koppelhus, Eva B. 2005. "Campanian palynomorphs", in ''Dinosaur Provincial Park'', pp. 101–130. The anatomically similar ''L. lambei'', ''L. magnicristatus'', and ''Corythosaurus'' were separated by time within the formation, based on stratigraphy. ''Corythosaurus'' fossils are known from the lower two-thirds of the Formation, ''L. lambei'' fossils are present in the upper third, and ''L. magnicristatus'' remains are rare and present only at the very top, where the marine influence was greater.
