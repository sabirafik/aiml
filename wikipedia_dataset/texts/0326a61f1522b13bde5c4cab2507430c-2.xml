Many species have the ability to translocate the pigment inside chromatophores, resulting in an apparent change in colour. This process, known as ''physiological colour change'', is most widely studied in melanophores, since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment. In most species with a relatively thin dermis, the dermal melanophores tend to be flat and cover a large surface area. However, in animals with thick dermal layers, such as adult reptiles, dermal melanophores often form three-dimensional units with other chromatophores. These dermal chromatophore units (DCU) consist of an uppermost xanthophore or erythrophore layer, then an iridophore layer, and finally a basket-like melanophore layer with processes covering the iridophores. Bagnara JT ''et al.'' The dermal chromatophore unit. ''J Cell Biol''. 1968; 38:67–79. PMID 5691979 .

Both types of dermal melanophores are important in physiological colour change. Flat dermal melanophores will often overlay other chromatophores so when the pigment is dispersed throughout the cell the skin appears dark. When the pigment is aggregated towards the centre of the cell, the pigments in other chromatophores are exposed to light and the skin takes on their hue. Similarly, after melanin aggregation in DCUs, the skin appears green through xanthophore (yellow) filtering of scattered light from the iridophore layer. On the dispersion of melanin, the light is no longer scattered and the skin appears dark. As the other biochromatic chomatophores are also capable of pigment translocation, animals with multiple chromatophore types can generate a spectacular array of skin colours by making good use of the divisional effect.

The control and mechanics of rapid pigment translocation has been well studied in a number of different species, particularly amphibians and teleost fish. Deacon SW ''et al.'' Dynactin is required for bidirectional organelle transport. ''J Cell Biol''. 2003; 160:297-301. PMID 12551954 , Fujii R. The regulation of motile activity in fish chromatophores. ''Pigment Cell Res''. 2000; 13:300-19. PMID 11041206 It has been demonstrated that the process can be under hormonal, neuronal control or both. Neurochemicals that are known to translocate pigment include noradrenaline, through its receptor on the surface on melanophores. Aspengren S ''et al.'' Noradrenaline- and melatonin-mediated regulation of pigment aggregation in fish melanophores. ''Pigment Cell Res''. 2003; 16:59–64. PMID 12519126 The primary hormones involved in regulating translocation appear to be the melanocortins, melatonin and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), that are produced mainly in the pituitary, pineal gland and hypothalamus respectively. These hormones may also be generated in a paracrine fashion by cells in the skin. At the surface of the melanophore the hormones have been shown to activate specific G-protein coupled receptors that, in turn, transduce the signal into the cell. Melanocortins result in the dispersion of pigment, while melatonin and MCH results in aggregation.

Through a mechanism not yet fully understood, cAMP influences other proteins such as protein kinase A to drive molecular motors carrying pigment containing vesicles along both microtubules and microfilaments.
