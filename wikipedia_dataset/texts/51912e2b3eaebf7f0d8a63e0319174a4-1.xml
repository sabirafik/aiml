Although smaller than ''Tyrannosaurus'', ''Tarbosaurus'' was one of the largest tyrannosaurids. The largest known individuals were between 10 and 12 meters (33 to 40 ft) long, each with a head held up to 5 meters (16.5 ft) above the ground. The mass of a fully grown individual has never been published, although it is considered comparable to or slightly smaller than ''Tyrannosaurus''.

The largest known ''Tarbosaurus'' skull is more than 1.3 meters (4 ft) long, larger than all other tyrannosaurids except ''Tyrannosaurus''. The skull was tall, like that of ''Tyrannosaurus'', but not as wide, especially towards the rear. The unexpanded rear of the skull meant that ''Tarbosaurus'' eyes did not face directly forwards, suggesting that it lacked the binocular vision of ''Tyrannosaurus''. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. Between 60 and 64 teeth lined its jaws, slightly more than in ''Tyrannosaurus'' but fewer than in smaller tyrannosaurids like ''Gorgosaurus'' and ''Alioramus''. Most of its teeth were oval in cross section, although the teeth of the premaxilla at the tip of the upper jaw had a ''D''-shaped cross section. This heterodonty is characteristic of the family. The longest teeth were in the maxilla (upper jaw bone), with crowns up to 85 millimeters (3.3 in) long. In the lower jaw, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone articulated with the rear of the dentary bone, creating a locking mechanism unique to ''Tarbosaurus'' and ''Alioramus''. Other tyrannosaurids lacked this ridge and had more flexibility in the lower jaw.

Tyrannosaurids varied little in body form, and ''Tarbosaurus'' was no exception. The head was supported by an ''S''-shaped neck, while the rest of the vertebral column, including the long tail, was held horizontally. ''Tarbosaurus'' had tiny, two-fingered forelimbs, which were smaller relative to its body size than those of any other member of the family. In contrast, the three-toed hindlimbs were long and thick, supporting the body in a bipedal posture. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips.
