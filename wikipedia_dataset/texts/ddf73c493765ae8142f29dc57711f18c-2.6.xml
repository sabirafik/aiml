In the 1970s clubs began to create strongly individual strips, and in 1975 Leeds United, who had changed their traditional blue and gold colours to all white in the 1960s to mimic Real Madrid, became the first club to design shirts which could be sold to fans in the form of replicas.  Driven by commercial concerns, other clubs soon followed suit, adding manufacturers' logos and a higher level of trim.  In 1973, German team Eintracht Braunschweig signed a deal with local alcohol producer Jägermeister to display its logo on the front of their shirts.  Soon almost all major clubs had signed such deals, and the cost to companies who sponsor large teams has increased dramatically. In 2008 German club FC Bayern Munich received €25 million in sponsorship money from Deutsche Telekom.  Spanish clubs, FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, however, refused to allow sponsors' logos to appear on their shirts as recently as 2005.  Even today, Barcelona has refused paying sponsors in favour of wearing the UNICEF logo on their shirts while donating €1.5 million to the charity per year.  Players also began to sign sponsorship deals with individual companies.  In 1974 Johan Cruijff refused to wear the Dutch national team's strip as its Adidas branding conflicted with his own individual contract with Puma, and was permitted to wear a version without the Adidas branding.  Puma had also paid Pelé $120,000 to wear their boots and specifically requested that he bend down and tie his laces at the start of the 1970 FIFA World Cup final, ensuring a close-up of the boots for a worldwide television audience.

In the 1980s manufacturers such as Hummel and Adidas began to design shirts with increasingly intricate designs, as new technology led to the introduction of such design elements as shadow prints and pinstripes.  Hummel's distinctive halved strip designed for the Danish national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup caused a stir in the media but concern was raised by FIFA over its appearance on television.  Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 80s, and often included the player's number on the front. In the 1991 FA Cup Final Tottenham Hotspur's players lined up in long baggy shorts.  At the time the new look was derided, but within a short period of time clubs both in Britain and elsewhere had adopted the longer shorts.  In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes.  Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt to look good when worn by fans as a fashion item, but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time.  In 1996, Manchester United notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed to look good when worn with jeans, but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager Alex Ferguson claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3–0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch.  United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply.  The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers, whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season.  A brief fad arose for players celebrating goals by lifting or completely removing their shirts to reveal political, religious or personal slogans printed on undershirts.  This led to a ruling from the International Football Association Board in 2002 that undershirts must not contain slogans or logos; since 2004 it has been a bookable offence for players to remove their shirts.


The market for replica shirts has grown enormously, with the revenue generated for leading clubs and the frequency with which they change designs coming under increased scrutiny, especially in the United Kingdom, where the market for replicas is worth in excess of £200m.  Several clubs have been accused of price fixing, and in 2003 Manchester United were fined £1.65m by the Office of Fair Trading.  The high prices charged for replicas have also led to many fans buying fake shirts which are imported from countries such as Thailand and Malaysia.  Nonetheless, the chance for fans to purchase a shirt bearing the name and number of a star player can lead to significant revenue for a club.  In the first six months after David Beckham's transfer to Real Madrid the club sold more than one million shirts bearing his name.  A market has also developed for shirts worn by players during significant matches, which are sold as collector's items.  The shirt worn by Pelé in the 1970 FIFA World Cup Final sold at auction for over £150,000 in 2002.

A number of advances in kit design have taken place since 2000, with varying degrees of success.  In 2002 the Cameroon national team competed in the African Cup of Nations in Mali wearing shirts with no sleeves, but FIFA later ruled that such garments were not considered to be shirts and therefore were not permitted under the Laws of the Game.  Manufacturers Puma AG initially added "invisible" black sleeves in order to comply with the ruling, but later supplied the team with new one-piece singlet-style tops.  FIFA ordered the team not to wear the tops but the ruling was disregarded, with the result that the Cameroon team was deducted six points in its qualifying campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, a decision later reversed after an appeal.  More successful were the skin-tight shirts designed for the Italian national team by manufacturers Kappa, a style subsequently emulated by other national teams and club sides.
