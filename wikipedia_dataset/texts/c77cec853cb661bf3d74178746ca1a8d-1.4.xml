The play widely regarded as Synge's masterpiece, ''The Playboy of the Western World'', was first performed in the Abbey in January 1907. The comedy centers on the story of apparent parricide and attracted a wide hostile reaction from the Irish public. The Freeman's Journal described it as "an unmitigated, protracted libel upon Irish peasant men, and worse still upon Irish girlhood".Ferriter 2004, 94–95 Egged on by nationalists, including Arthur Griffith, who believed that the theatre was insufficiently politically active and described it as "a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language we have ever listened to from a public platform", and with the pretext of a perceived slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood in the line "... a drift of chosen females, standing in their shift ..." At the time a shift was known as a symbol representing Kitty O'Shea and adultery.Price 1961, 15, 25 However, George Watson explained the real problem with the play when he says, "this heady mixture of English stereotypical images of Irish violence, of Irish resentment of those images, and of Synge's stress on violence, which for him is almost synonymous with vitality, is, far more than the word 'shift', what made ''The Playboy'' so explosive."Watson 1979, 72 A significant portion of the crowd rioted, causing the third act of the play to be acted out in dumb show.Isherwood 2004 

Yeats returned from Scotland to address the crowd on the second night, and decided to call in the police. Press opinion soon turned against the rioters and the protests petered out. Yeats later referred to this incident in a speech to the Abbey audience in 1926 on the fourth night of Seán O'Casey's ''The Plough and the Stars'', when he declared: "You have disgraced yourselves again. Is this to be an ever-recurring celebration of the arrival of Irish genius? Synge first and then O'Casey?"Gassner 2002, 468

Although writing of ''The Tinker's Wedding'' begun at the same time as ''Riders to the Sea'' and ''The Shadow of the glen'', it took Synge five years to complete, and was finished in 1907. It was performed in the Racquet Court theatre in Galway 4-8 January, 1907 and not performed again until 1909, and only then in London. The first critic to respond to the play was Daniel Corkery, who said, "One is sorry Synge ever wrote so poor a thing, and one fails to understand why it ever should have been staged anywhere."Corkery 1931, 152 This claim was popularly held by critics for many decades after. That same year, Synge became engaged to the Abbey actress Maire O'Neill (formerly known as Molly Allgood). He died at the Elpis Nursing Home in Dublin. His ''Poems and Translations'' was published by the Cuala Press on 8 April with a preface by Yeats. Yeats and Molly Allgood completed Synge's unfinished final play, ''Deirdre of the Sorrows'', and it was presented by the Abbey players in January 1910 with Allgood in the lead role. Synge died in Dublin, 24 March 1909. He is buried in Mount Jerome Graveyard, Harolds Cross, Dublin 6.
