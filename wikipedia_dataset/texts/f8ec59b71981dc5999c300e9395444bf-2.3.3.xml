Different traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearian iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the Anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes.  However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition.  For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop.  Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.  Regularity can vary between language.  In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur or occurs to a much lesser extent in English.Nabokov. ''Notes on Prosody''.

Some common metrical patterns, with notable examples of poets and poems who use them, include:
* Iambic pentameter (John Milton, ''Paradise Lost''Two versions of ''Paradise Lost'' are freely available on-line from Project Gutenberg,  and . )
* Dactylic hexameter (Homer, ''Iliad;''The original text, as translated by Samuel Butler, is available at Wikisource., Virgil, Aeneid; Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'')
* Iambic tetrameter (Andrew Marvell, "To His Coy Mistress"; Aleksandr Pushkin, ''Eugene Onegin'')The full text is available online both in Russian and as translated into English by Charles Johnston. Please see the pages on ''Eugene Onegin'' and on ''Notes on Prosody'' and the references on those pages for discussion of the problems of translation and of the differences between Russian and English iambic tetrameter.
* Trochaic octameter (Edgar Allan Poe, "The Raven")The full text of "The Raven" is available at Wikisource.
* Anapestic tetrameter (Lewis Carroll, "The Hunting of the Snark"; Lord Byron, ''Don Juan'')
