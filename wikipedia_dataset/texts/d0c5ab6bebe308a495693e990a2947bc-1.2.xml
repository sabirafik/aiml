On the 6th and 7th of December, 1940, the German auxiliary cruisers ''Komet'' and ''Orion'' sunk four supply ships in the vicinity of Nauru. On the next day, ''Komet'' shelled Nauru's phosphate mining areas, oil storage depots, and the shiploading cantilever.  The attacks seriously disrupted phosphate supplies to Australia and New Zealand (mostly used for munition and fertilizer purposes.)
