Earmarked for the offensive into Saudi Arabia was the Iraqi Third Corps,Williams, p. 3 the 1st Mechanized Division from Fourth Corps and a number of commando units.Mahnken & Watts, p. 155 Third Corps, commanded by Major General Salah Aboud Mahmoud (who would also command the overall offensive), was composed of the 3rd Armored Division and 5th Mechanized Division. Fourth Corps' commander was Major General Yaiyd Khalel Zaki. The 3rd Armored Division had a number of T-72 tanks, the only non-Republican Guard force to have them, while the other armored battalions had T-62s and T-55s, a few of which had an Iraqi appliqué armor similar to the Soviet bulging armor also known as "brow" laminate armor or BDD. During the battle of Khafji, these upgraded T-55s survived impacts from Milan anti-tank missiles.Zaloga (2004), p. 36 These divisions also had armored personnel vehicles such as the BMP-1, scout vehicles such as the BRDM-2, and several types of artillery. Also deployed along this portion of the front, though not chosen to participate in the invasion, were five infantry divisions that were under orders to remain in their defensive positions along the border.Westermeyer, p. 5



U.S. Marine Corps reconnaissance estimated that the Iraqi Army had amassed around 60,000 troops across the border, near the Kuwaiti town of Wafra, in as many as 5 or 6 divisions.Williams, p. 13 Infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some infantry divisions could have up to eight brigades&ndash;however most infantry divisions along the border were understrength, primarily due to desertion.Rottman, p. 51 Armored and mechanized divisions normally made use of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these were generally a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion, or vice versa.Rottman, pp. 51–52 Given the size of the forces deployed across the border, it is thought that the Iraqi Army planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Al-Khafji, in order to seize the valuable oil fields at Damman.

The attack would consist of a four-prong offensive. The 1st Mechanized Division would pass through the 7th and 14th Infantry Divisions to protect the flank of the 3rd Armored Division, which would provide a blocking force west of Al-Khafji while the 5th Mechanized Division took the town. The 1st Mechanized and 3rd Armored divisions would then retire to Kuwait, while the 5th Mechanized Division would wait until the Coalition launched a counteroffensive. The principal objectives were to inflict heavy casualties on the attacking Coalition soldiers and take prisoners of war, whom Saddam Hussein theorized would be an excellent bargaining tool with the Coalition.Westermeyer, pp. 5–6

As the units moved to the Saudi border, many were attacked by Coalition aircraft. Around the Al-Wafrah forest, about 1,000 Iraqi armored fighting vehicles were attacked by Harrier aircraft with Rockeye cluster bombs.Williams, pp. 14–15 Another Iraqi convoy of armored vehicles was hit by A-10s, which destroyed the first and last vehicles, before systematically attacking the stranded remainder.Williams, p. 15 Such air raids prevented the majority of the Iraqi troops deployed for the offensive from taking part in it.Williams, p. 16
