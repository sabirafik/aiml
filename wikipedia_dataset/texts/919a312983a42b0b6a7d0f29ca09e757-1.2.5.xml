From 1862 to 1867, the theatre was managed by James Henry Mapleson, presenting Italian, French and German opera, including the British premières of ''La forza del destino'', ''Médée'', ''Faust'' and ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', and promoting such singers as Mario, Giulia Grisi, De Murska, Therese Tietjens, Antonio Giuglini, Charles Santley and Christine Nilsson.Mapleson, J. H. ''The Mapleson Memoirs'', ed. H. Rosenthal, (London, 1966) On the night of 6 December 1867, the theatre was destroyed by fire, thought to have been caused by an overheated stove. Only the bare walls of the theatre remained, and most of the adjacent shops in Pall Mall, and the Clergy Club hotel in Charles Street, suffered damage of varying severity. The Royal Opera Arcade, on the western side, survived with only superficial damage. With the destruction of the theatre, Mapleson took his company to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

By the 1850s, with the era of the romantic ballet at an end, the principal personalities of the ballet, such as Perrot, Saint-Léon, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the Tsar's Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia. Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted until the end of the 19th century.Ballet continued to be performed in London, but in the Music halls and theatres as interludes and endpieces. The most notable of these were the corps at the Alhambra, and its nearby rival, the Empire Theatre. Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as Adeline Genée began performing. PeoplePlayUK, accessed 18 December 2007 The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the Old Vic and soon took on the name of the Vic-Wells Ballet. Later, relocating primarily to the Sadler's Wells Theatre, the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Eventually the troupe began performing at the Royal Opera House and became the Royal Ballet, as it is known today. Royal Opera House, accessed 11 February 2008
