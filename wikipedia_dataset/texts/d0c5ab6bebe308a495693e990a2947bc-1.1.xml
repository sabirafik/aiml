Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's Marshall Island Protectorate. The Germans called the island Nawodo or Onawero. The arrival of the Germans ended the war, and social changes brought about by the war established kings as rulers of the island. The most widely-known of these was King Auweyida. Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888.Ellis, A. F. 1935. ''Ocean Island and Nauru - their story''. Angus and Robertson Limited. pp 29–39  The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades. Robert Rasch, a German Trader who married a native woman, was the first administrator, appointed in 1890.

Phosphate was discovered on Nauru in 1900 by the prospector Albert Ellis. The Pacific Phosphate Company started to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany. The company exported its first shipment in 1907.Ellis, A. F. 1935. ''Ocean Island and Nauru - their story''. Angus and Robertson Limited. pp 127–139   In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Nauru was captured by Australian troops.  Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom signed the Nauru Island Agreement in 1919, creating a board known as the British Phosphate Commission (BPC). This took over the rights to phosphate mining.
According to the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics (now the Australian Bureau of Statistics), "In common with other natives, the islanders are very susceptible to tuberculosis and influenza, and in 1921 an influenza epidemic caused the deaths of 230 islanders." In 1923, the League of Nations gave Australia a trustee mandate over Nauru, with the United Kingdom and New Zealand being co-trustees, also.Cain, Timothy M., comp. "Nauru."
