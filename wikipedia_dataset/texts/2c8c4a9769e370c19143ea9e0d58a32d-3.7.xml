The first air attack took off at 12:30pm on 3 June, consisting of nine B-17s operating from Midway. Four hours later they found the Japanese transport group 570 miles to the west.Admiral Nimitz's  of the battle. From Hyperwar, retrieved 2008-02-13 Under heavy anti-aircraft fire, they dropped their bombs. Though hits were reported, none of the bombs actually landed on target and no significant damage was inflicted. USSBS From Hyperwar, retrieved 2008-02-14 Early the following morning, Japanese oil tanker ''Akebono Maru'' sustained the first hit when a torpedo from an attacking PBY flying boat struck her around 01:00.

At 04:30 on 4 June, Nagumo launched his initial attack on Midway itself, consisting of 36 Aichi D3A dive-bombers and 36 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers, escorted by 36 Zero fighters. At the same time, he launched combat air patrol (CAP), as well as his eight search aircraft (one from the heavy cruiser ''Tone'' launched 30 minutes late due to technical difficulties).

Japanese reconnaissance arrangements were flimsy, with too few aircraft to adequately cover the assigned search areas, laboring under poor weather conditions to the northeast and east of the task force.Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 107–112; 132–133. Yamamoto's faulty dispositions had now become a serious liability.Willmott, ''Barrier''.

American radar picked up the enemy at a distance of several miles and interceptors were soon scrambled. Unescorted bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carrier fleet, their fighter escorts remaining behind to defend Midway. At 06:20, Japanese carrier aircraft bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base. Midway-based Marine fighter pilots, flying obsolescent Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats and obsoleteStephen, Martin. ''Sea Battles in Close-up: World War Two'' (Shepperton, Surrey: Ian Allan, 1988), Volume 1, pp.166 & 167. Brewster F2A-3s, intercepted the Japanese and suffered heavy losses, though they managed to destroy four bombers and at least three Zeros. Most of the U.S. planes were downed in the first few minutes; several were damaged, and only two remained flyable. In all, three F4Fs and 13 F2As were shot down. American anti-aircraft fire was accurate and intense, damaging many Japanese aircraft and claiming a third of the Japanese planes destroyed.Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 200–204. 

The Japanese did not succeed in neutralizing Midway. Another attack would be necessary before troops could be landed on 7 June; American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force.Lord, ''Incredible Victory'', p. 110; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 149.

Having taken off prior to the Japanese attack, American bombers based on Midway made several attacks on the Japanese carrier fleet. These included six TBF Avengers from ''Hornet'''s VT-8, their crews on their first combat operation, and four USAAC B-26 Marauders armed with torpedoes. The Japanese shrugged off these attacks with almost no losses (as few as two fighters lost), while destroying all but one TBF and two B-26s. One B-26, hit by anti-aircraft fire from ''Akagi'', made no attempt to pull out of its run and narrowly missed crashing directly into the carrier's' bridge. This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order the reserve strike force be kept armed for anti-ship operations.Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 207–212; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 149–152.



Admiral Nagumo, in accordance with Japanese carrier doctrine at the time, had kept half of his aircraft in reserve. These comprised two squadrons each of dive bombers and torpedo bombers, the latter armed with torpedoes, should any American warships be located. The dive bombers were, as yet, unarmed.Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.130–132. As a result of the attacks from Midway, as well as the morning flight leader's recommendation of a second strike, at 07:15, Nagumo ordered his reserve planes to be re-armed with contact-fused general purpose bombs for use against land targets. Some sources maintain that this had been underway for about 30 minutes when, at 07:40Lord, Walter. ''Incredible Victory''; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''; Fuchida & Okumiya, ''Midway'' the delayed scout plane from ''Tone'' signaled the discovery of a sizable American naval force to the east; however, new evidence suggests Nagumo did not receive the sighting report until 08:00, so the rearming operation actually proceeded for 45 minutes.Isom, ''Midway Inquest: Why the Japanese Lost the Battle of Midway'', pp.129-139 Nagumo quickly reversed his order and demanded the scout plane ascertain the composition of the American force. Another 40 minutes elapsed before ''Tone'''s scout finally radioed the presence of a single carrier in the American force, TF 16 (the other carrier being missed).Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp.216–217; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.159–161 & 183.

Nagumo was now in a quandary. Rear Admiral Yamaguchi Tamon, leading Carrier Division 2 (''Hiryū'' and ''Sōryū''), recommended Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A2 dive bombers each on ''Sōryū'' and ''Hiryū'', and half the ready cover patrol aircraft.Bicheno, Hugh. ''Midway'' (London: Orion Publishing Group, 2001), p.134. Nagumo's seeming opportunity to hit the American ships,Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.165–170. however, was now limited by the fact his Midway strike force would be returning shortly and needing to land promptly or ditch (as is commonly believed).Fuchida and Okumiya, ''Midway''; Willmott, ''Barrier & the Javelin''. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never had an opportunity to spot their reserve for launch. The few aircraft on the Japanese flight decks at the time of the attack were either defensive fighters, or (in the case of ''Sōryū'') fighters being spotted to augment the task force defenses.Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 231, derived from ''Senshi Sōshō'', pp. 372–378. Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would have required at least 30–45 minutes.Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.121–124. Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserve to battle without proper anti-ship armament; he had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down.Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' p.233. (In the event, poor discipline saw many of the Japanese bombers ditch their bombs and attempt to dogfight interceptor F4Fs.)Bicheno, p.163. Japanese carrier doctrine preferred fully constituted strikes, and without confirmation (until 08:20) of whether the American force included carriers, Nagumo's reaction was doctrinaire.Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' pp.217–218 & 372–373; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.170–173. In addition, the arrival of another American air strike at 07:53 gave weight to the need to attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo chose to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed and ready.Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp.231–237; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.170–173; Willmott, ''Barrier & the Javelin''; Fuchida & Okumiya, ''Midway''. In the final analysis, it made no difference; Fletcher had launched beginning at 07:00, so the aircraft which would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. There was nothing Nagumo could do about it. This was the fatal flaw of Yamamoto's dispositions: it followed strictly traditional battleship doctrine.Willmott, ''Barrier & the Javelin''; Fuchida & Okumiya, ''Midway''.
