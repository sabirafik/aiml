Low, Harris and their ships left the Azores for the Carolinas. On 10 June 1723, they suffered a resounding defeat in a battle with , a heavily armed man of war. The ''Greyhound'' had been dispatched under the command of Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low fled in the ''Fancy'' with a skeleton crew and Â£150,000 on board and headed back to the Azores, leaving Harris and the ''Ranger'' behind. Twenty-five of the crew of the ''Ranger'', including the ship's doctor, were tried between 10 July and 12 July, with Solgard giving evidence and recounting the battle. The men were hanged for felony, piracy and robbery, near Newport, Rhode Island, on 19 July 1723. Harris was sent back to England and hanged at Wapping. When Solgard returned to New York, he was presented with the freedom of the city and a gold snuffbox for his part in bringing some of Low's crew to justice.

Low, still captaining the ''Fancy'', sailed north. He captured a whaling vessel 80 miles (130 km) out at sea, and in a foul mood following the encounter with the ''Greyhound'' and the loss of his right hand man, Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death (they were lucky, and reached Nantucket after a difficult journey). Remaining off the coast of North America, his crew took a fishing boat near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.

Heading south again, Low captured a 22-gun French ship and a large Virginian merchant vessel, the ''Merry Christmas'', in late June 1723. Following the defeat by the ''Greyhound'', Low became "peculiarly cruel" to his English victims. His fleet of three ships rejoined forces with George Lowther in July. In late 1723, Low and Lowther's fleet captured the ''Delight'' off the coast of Guinea, mounting fourteen guns on her, with command being given to Spriggs. Two days later, Spriggs and Lowther both abandoned Low, leaving him the ''Merry Christmas'', by now mounted with 34 guns, as his sole ship.

There are conflicting reports on the circumstances of Edward Low's death. Charles Johnson&mdash;considered by some to be Daniel Defoe writing under a pseudonym&mdash;stated in his ''A General History of the Pyrates'', at odds with other sources, that Edward Low and the ''Fancy'' were last sighted near the Canaries and Guinea but at the time of his 1724 book, no further reports had surfaced. He noted one rumour that Low was sailing for Brazil and another that Low's ship sank in a storm with the loss of all hands. The National Maritime Museum in London states that he was never caught, ending his days in Brazil.

''The Pirates Own Book'' and Ossian both suggest that Low was set adrift without provisions by the crew of the ''Merry Christmas'', in a mutiny brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument. Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial, and was hanged in Martinique, in 1724.
