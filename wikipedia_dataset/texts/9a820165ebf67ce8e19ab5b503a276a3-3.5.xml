Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose never managed to develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of ''sec''' (سجع, also transliterated as ''seci''), or rhymed prose,Belge, 389 a type of writing descended from the Arabic ''saj''' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a rhyme.

Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time. This tradition was exclusively nonfictional in nature—the fiction tradition was limited to narrative poetry.One apparent exception was the ''Muhayyelât'' (مخيّلات "''Fancies''") of Ali Aziz Efendi of Crete, a collection of stories of the fantastic that was written in 1796, though not published until 1867. A number of such nonfictional prose genres developed:

* the ''târih'' (تاريخ), or history, a tradition in which there are many notable writers, including the 15th-century historian Aşıkpaşazâde and the 17th-century historians Kâtib Çelebi and Naîmâ
* the ''seyâhatnâme'' (سياحت نامه), or travelogue, of which the outstanding example is the 17th-century ''Seyahâtnâme'' of Evliya Çelebi
* the ''sefâretnâme'' (سفارت نامه), a related genre specific to the journeys and experiences of an Ottoman ambassador, and which is best exemplified by the 1718–1720 ''Paris Sefâretnâmesi'' of Yirmisekiz Mehmed Çelebi, ambassador to the court of Louis XV of France
* the ''siyâsetnâme'' (سياست نامه), a kind of political treatise describing the functionings of state and offering advice for rulers, an early Seljuk example of which is the 11th-century ''Siyāsatnāma'', written in Persian by Nizam al-Mulk, vizier to the Seljuk rulers Alp Arslan and Malik Shah I
* the ''tezkîre'' (تذکره), a collection of short biographies of notable figures, some of the most notable of which were the 16th-century ''tezkiretü'ş-şuarâ''s (تذكرة الشعرا), or biographies of poets, by Latîfî and Aşık Çelebi
* the ''münşeât'' (منشآت), a collection of writings and letters similar to the Western tradition of ''belles-lettres''
* the ''münâzara'' (مناظره), a collection of debates of either a religious or a philosophical nature
