In 1906, the commissioning of HMS ''Dreadnought'' brought about the obsolescence of all existing battleships. ''Dreadnought'', by scrapping the secondary battery, was able to carry ten  guns rather than four. She could fire eight heavy guns broadside, as opposed to four from a pre-dreadnought; and six guns ahead, as opposed to two.Massie, ''Dreadnought'', p. 473. The move to an 'all-big-gun' design was a logical conclusion of the increasingly long engagement ranges and heavier secondary batteries of the last pre-dreadnoughts; Japan and the USA had designed ships with a similar armament before ''Dreadnought'', but were unable to complete them before the British ship.Sumrall, p. 15; Jentschura, Jung, Mickel p. 23. It was felt that only the largest guns were effective in battle, and by mounting more 12-inch guns ''Dreadnought'' was two to three times more effective in combat than an existing battleship.Massie, ''Dreadnought'', pp. 471-3.

The armament of the new breed of ships was not their only crucial advantage. ''Dreadnought'' used steam turbines for propulsion, giving her a top speed of 21 knots, against the 18 knots typical of the pre-dreadnought battleships. Able both to outgun and outmaneuver their opponents, the dreadnought battleships decisively outclassed earlier battleship designs.

Nevertheless, pre-dreadnoughts continued in active service and saw significant combat use even when obsolete. Dreadnoughts and battlecruisers were believed vital for the decisive naval battles which at the time all nations expected, hence were jealously guarded against the risk of damage by mines or submarine attack, and kept close to home as much as possible. The obsolescence and consequent expendability of the pre-dreadnoughts meant that they could be deployed into more dangerous situations and more far-flung areas.Massie, ''Castles of Steel'', p. 433.

The only pre-dreadnought preserved today is the Japanese Navy's flagship at the Battle of Tsushima, the ''Mikasa'', which is now located in Yokosuka, where it has been a museum ship since 1925.
